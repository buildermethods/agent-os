# Feature Specification Creation for GitHub Copilot

## Purpose
Create detailed, actionable specifications for new features or enhancements. This ensures systematic development with clear requirements, technical approaches, and task breakdowns.

## When to Use
- User asks "what's next?" (suggests next roadmap item)
- User requests a specific feature or enhancement
- Need to plan a significant change or addition
- Breaking down large features into manageable pieces

## What This Creates
- Spec folder with timestamp and feature name
- `spec-lite.md` - Executive summary and overview
- `tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown with estimates
- `sub-specs/technical-spec.md` - Technical implementation details
- Optional: Additional sub-specs for complex features

## Required Information

Before creating a spec, gather:
- **Feature description**: What needs to be built
- **User value**: Why this feature matters
- **Success criteria**: How to know it's complete
- **Technical constraints**: Any limitations or requirements

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Determine Feature Scope

**Option A: User asks "what's next?"**
1. Check `@.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
2. Find next uncompleted roadmap item
3. Suggest to user and get approval

**Option B: User specifies feature**
1. Clarify feature requirements with user
2. Ensure alignment with product mission
3. Check if feature exists on roadmap

### 2. Create Spec Directory Structure
```bash
# Create spec folder with format: YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name
mkdir specs/2025-01-XX-feature-name
mkdir specs/2025-01-XX-feature-name/sub-specs
```

### 3. Generate Spec Overview (spec-lite.md)

Create concise summary with:
- **Problem Statement**: What problem this solves
- **Proposed Solution**: High-level approach
- **User Impact**: How users benefit
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable completion criteria

Template structure:
```markdown
# [Feature Name]

## Problem Statement
[2-3 sentences describing the problem]

## Proposed Solution
[2-3 sentences describing the approach]

## User Impact
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

## Technical Approach
[Brief overview of implementation strategy]
```

### 4. Create Technical Specification

Generate `sub-specs/technical-spec.md` with:
- **Architecture decisions**
- **Technology choices** 
- **Integration points**
- **Data models**
- **API designs**
- **Testing strategy**

### 5. Break Down Into Tasks

Create `tasks.md` with detailed task breakdown:
- **Parent tasks** (major work chunks)
- **Subtasks** (atomic work items)
- **Time estimates** (realistic planning)
- **Dependencies** (task ordering)
- **Acceptance criteria** (completion definition)

Use this structure:
```markdown
# Tasks for [Feature Name]

## Parent Task 1: [Major Work Chunk]
**Estimated Time**: X hours
**Status**: Not Started

### Subtasks:
- [ ] **Subtask 1.1**: [Specific action] - [time estimate]
- [ ] **Subtask 1.2**: [Specific action] - [time estimate]

## Parent Task 2: [Major Work Chunk]
**Estimated Time**: X hours
**Status**: Not Started

### Subtasks:
- [ ] **Subtask 2.1**: [Specific action] - [time estimate]
- [ ] **Subtask 2.2**: [Specific action] - [time estimate]
```

### 6. Quality Review

Before finalizing, ensure:
- [ ] Spec is clear and actionable
- [ ] Tasks are appropriately sized (2-4 hours each)
- [ ] Technical approach is sound
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Dependencies are identified

## Best Practices

### Task Sizing
- **Subtasks**: 30 minutes to 4 hours maximum
- **Parent tasks**: Collection of related subtasks
- **Break down**: Anything over 4 hours into smaller pieces

### Technical Specifications
- Reference existing codebase patterns
- Consider error handling and edge cases
- Plan for testing at each level
- Document integration points

### Success Criteria
- Use measurable outcomes
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements
- Consider user experience metrics
- Plan for testing and validation

## Next Steps

After creating a specification:
1. Review with stakeholders if needed
2. Begin implementation using `@.github/instructions/execute-tasks.instruction.md`
3. Update roadmap status if applicable
4. Track progress in tasks.md during development

## Integration with Agent OS

Feature specs integrate with:
- **Product mission**: Ensures alignment with goals
- **Roadmap**: Tracks feature completion status
- **Standards**: Follows established coding practices
- **Task execution**: Provides clear implementation plan

All specs should reference and align with the broader Agent OS workflow and product documentation.
