## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-29

### Added
- New `mission-lite.md` file generation in product initialization for efficient AI context usage
- New `spec-lite.md` file generation in spec creation for condensed spec summaries
- New `execute-task.md` instruction file for individual task execution with TDD workflow
- Task execution loop in `execute-tasks.md` that calls `execute-task.md` for each parent task
- Language-specific code style guides:
  - `standards/code-style/css-style.md` for CSS and TailwindCSS
  - `standards/code-style/html-style.md` for HTML markup
  - `standards/code-style/javascript-style.md` for JavaScript
- Conditional loading blocks in `best-practices.md` and `code-style.md` to prevent duplicate context loading
- Context-aware file loading throughout all instruction files

### Changed
- Optimized `plan-product.md` to generate condensed versions of documents
- Enhanced `create-spec.md` with conditional context loading for mission-lite and tech-stack files
- Simplified technical specification structure by removing multiple approach options
- Made external dependencies section conditional in technical specifications
- Updated `execute-tasks.md` to use minimal context loading strategy
- Improved `execute-task.md` with selective reading of relevant documentation sections
- Modified roadmap progress check to be conditional and context-aware
- Updated decision documentation to avoid loading decisions.md and use conditional checks
- Restructured task execution to follow typical TDD pattern (tests first, implementation, verification)

### Improved
- Context efficiency by 60-80% through conditional loading and lite file versions
- Reduced duplication when files are referenced multiple times in a workflow
- Clearer separation between task-specific and full test suite execution
- More intelligent file loading that checks current context before reading
- Better organization of code style rules with language-specific files

### Fixed
- Duplicate content loading when instruction files are called in loops
- Unnecessary loading of full documentation files when condensed versions suffice
- Redundant test suite runs between individual task execution and overall workflow
