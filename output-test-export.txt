> /peer is running… --continue --spec=walcommitter-operation-support

⏺ I'll continue the PEER pattern execution for the walcommitter-operation-support spec. Let me first check the current state and then proceed with the appropriate phase.

⏺ Bash(nats kv get agent-os-peer-state "peer.spec.walcommitter-operation-support.cycle.current" --raw 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND")
  ⎿  1

⏺ Bash(nats kv get agent-os-peer-state "peer.spec.walcommitter-operation-support.cycle.1" --raw | jq -r '.metadata.status, .metadata.current_phase' 2>/dev/null)
  ⎿  INITIALIZED
     planning

⏺ The PEER cycle is in the planning phase. Let me check what phase was last completed:

⏺ Bash(nats kv get agent-os-peer-state "peer.spec.walcommitter-operation-support.cycle.1" --raw | jq '.phases')
  ⎿  {                             
       "plan": {
         "status": "pending"
     … +11 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The planning phase hasn't been completed yet. Let me proceed with the planning phase using the peer-planner subagent:

⏺ peer-planner(Execute planning phase)
  ⎿  Done (14 tool uses · 107.8k tokens · 1m 51.7s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

⏺ Good! The planning phase is complete. Now let's proceed with the execution phase:

⏺ peer-executor(Execute instruction phase)
  ⎿  Done (19 tool uses · 109.3k tokens · 4m 54.5s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

⏺ Excellent! The execution phase is complete. Now let's move to the express phase to format and present the results:

⏺ peer-express(Format execution results)
  ⎿  Done (2 tool uses · 87.5k tokens · 1m 23.4s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

⏺ Claude Opus limit reached, now using Sonnet 4

⏺ Perfect! Now for the final phase - the review phase to assess execution quality:

⏺ peer-review(Review PEER execution)
  ⎿  Done (4 tool uses · 90.2k tokens · 3m 17.4s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

⏺ Finally, let me complete the PEER cycle by updating the final state:

⏺ Bash(nats kv get agent-os-peer-state "peer.spec.walcommitter-operation-support.cycle.1" --raw | jq '. | .metadata.status = "COMPLETED" | .metadata.completed_at = (no…)
  ⎿  jq: parse error: Invalid string: control characters from U+0000 through U+001F must be escaped at line 46, column 141

⏺ Bash(CURRENT_STATE=$(nats kv get agent-os-peer-state "peer.spec.walcommitter-operation-support.cycle.1" --raw)
      COMPLETED_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")…)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ PEER Cycle 1 Complete

  Instruction: create-spec
  Spec: walcommitter-operation-support

  ✅ Planning phase completed
  ✅ Execution phase completed
  ✅ Express phase completed
  ✅ Review phase completed

  Quality Score: 91/100 (HIGH)

  The specification for WAL committer operation support has been successfully created with comprehensive analysis, technical design, and implementation roadmap. The issue has been identified as the kv_cache_process function ignoring operation types from WAL messages, and a clear solution has been designed with
  proper backward compatibility.

  All outputs stored in NATS KV under: peer.spec.walcommitter-operation-support.cycle.1

  Ready to proceed with implementation using the created task breakdown.
