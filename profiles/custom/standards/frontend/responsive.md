## Responsive design best practices

- **Mobile-First Development**: Start with mobile layout and progressively enhance for larger screens. WordPress themes should be mobile-first by default.
- **Standard Breakpoints**: Consistently use standard breakpoints across the application (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop). WordPress uses common breakpoints; follow similar patterns or define your own consistently.
- **Fluid Layouts**: Use percentage-based widths and flexible containers that adapt to screen size. WordPress themes should use flexible layouts that work across devices.
- **Relative Units**: Prefer rem/em units over fixed pixels for better scalability and accessibility. WordPress core uses relative units; follow similar patterns.
- **Test Across Devices**: Test and verify UI changes across multiple screen sizes from mobile to tablet to desktop screen sizes and ensure a balanced, user-friendly viewing and reading experience on all
- **Touch-Friendly Design**: Ensure tap targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44x44px) for mobile users. WordPress admin and frontend should have touch-friendly interfaces.
- **Performance on Mobile**: Optimize images and assets for mobile network conditions and smaller screens. Use WordPress responsive images and appropriate image sizes.
- **Readable Typography**: Maintain readable font sizes across all breakpoints without requiring zoom. WordPress themes should maintain readable typography at all sizes.
- **Content Priority**: Show the most important content first on smaller screens through thoughtful layout decisions. WordPress themes should prioritize content appropriately on mobile.
- **WordPress Responsive Images**: Use WordPress responsive image features (`srcset`, `sizes` attributes) for optimal image delivery across devices
- **Viewport Meta Tag**: Ensure WordPress themes include proper viewport meta tag for responsive behavior
