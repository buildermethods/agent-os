## Code commenting best practices

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that explains itself through clear structure and naming
- **Minimal, helpful comments**: Add concise, minimal comments to explain large sections of code logic.
- **Don't comment changes or fixes**: Do not leave code comments that speak to recent or temporary changes or fixes. Comments should be evergreen informational texts that are relevant far into the future.
- **Function Docblocks**: When inserting new functions, use docblocks with `@since TBD` tag
- **Docblock Formatting**: In docblocks, align parameter names, types, and description starts vertically for readability
- **Docblock Punctuation**: Add a period at the end of description lines in docblocks
- **File Docblocks**: Every PHP file needs to have a docblock at the top before its namespace definition
