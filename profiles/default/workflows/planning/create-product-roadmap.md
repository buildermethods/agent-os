Generate `agent-os/product/roadmap.md` with an ordered feature checklist:

Do not include any tasks for initializing a new codebase or bootstrapping a new application. Assume the user is already inside the project's codebase and has a bare-bones application initialized.

#### Creating the Roadmap:

1. **Review the Mission** - Read `agent-os/product/mission.md` to understand the product's goals, target users, and success criteria.

2. **Identify Features** - Based on the mission, determine the list of concrete features needed to achieve the product vision.

3. **Strategic Ordering** - Order features based on:
   - Technical dependencies (foundational features first)
   - Most direct path to achieving the mission
   - Building incrementally from MVP to full product

4. **Create the Roadmap** - Use the structure below as your template. Replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[FEATURE_NAME]`, `[DESCRIPTION]`, `[EFFORT]`) with real content that you create based on the mission.

#### Roadmap Structure:
```markdown
# Product Roadmap

1. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
2. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
3. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
4. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
5. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
6. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
7. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
8. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`

> Notes
> - Order items by technical dependencies and product architecture
> - Each item should represent an end-to-end (frontend + backend) functional and testable feature
```

Effort scale:
- `XS`: 1 day
- `S`: 2-3 days
- `M`: 1 week
- `L`: 2 weeks
- `XL`: 3+ weeks

#### Important Constraints

- **Make roadmap actionable** - include effort estimates and dependencies
- **Priorities guided by mission** - When deciding on order, aim for the most direct path to achieving the mission as documented in mission.md
- **Ensure phases are achievable** - start with MVP, build incrementally
