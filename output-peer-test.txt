I'll execute the PEER pattern for creating a spec about fixing WAL template operations. Let me start by using the peer-planner agent to decompose this task.

⏺ peer-planner(Task: Plan WAL template spec creation (using peer-planner agent)

              Prompt: I need to create a spec for fixing WAL template operations. The issue is:

              1. WALWriterPipeline template allows multiple operations (put, delete, etc)
              2. WALCommitterPipeline template does not honor the operation - always performs put
              3. WALCommitterPipeline may not honor the key provided in the body from the WAL writer message

              I need to follow the Agent OS create-spec instruction located at @~/.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md to properly plan and create this specification.

              First, help me plan the approach for investigating the current WAL template implementations and creating a comprehensive spec for the fixes needed.)
  ⎿  Agent Response:
     Now let me present the spec for review and then create the tasks file:

     I've created the spec documentation for fixing WAL template operations. Here's what I've analyzed and documented:

     Current Issues Identified:
     1. WALWriterPipeline correctly allows multiple operations (put, delete, etc.) in transform_processors - I can see this in the transaction and users examples where "op": "put" is hardcoded
     2. WALCommitterPipeline uses kv_cache_process() helper which only performs cache_add/cache_set operations, ignoring the operation field entirely
     3. Key handling issue where custom keys from WAL writer messages may not be properly honored by the committer

     Spec Documentation Created:
     - Spec Requirements: @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-05-wal-template-operations-fix/spec.md
     - Spec Summary: @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-05-wal-template-operations-fix/spec-lite.md
     - Technical Spec: @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-05-wal-template-operations-fix/sub-specs/technical-spec.md

     The spec covers:
     - User Stories: For pipeline developers and banking transaction developers who need proper operation support
     - Technical Requirements: Detailed analysis of current issues and required fixes
     - Scope: Clear boundaries of what will be fixed vs. what's out of scope
     - Expected Deliverables: Fixed WALCommitterPipeline, enhanced key handling, and comprehensive tests

     Please review the spec documentation and let me know if any changes are needed before I create the task breakdown. The main focus is on enhancing the kv_cache_process() helper in /patterns/caches/kv.k to properly dispatch operations based on the WAL entry's op field, and ensuring keys are properly honored
     from the WAL entry body.
