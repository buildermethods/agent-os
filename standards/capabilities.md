# Agent OS Capability Framework

This document defines the capability provider framework that enables safe execution of complex system operations through declarative capability definitions, comprehensive simulation, and reliable rollback procedures. Capabilities provide a structured approach to operations that have side effects or interact with external systems.

## Overview

The capability framework transforms potentially risky operations into safe, declarative actions that can be simulated, validated, and executed with full rollback capabilities. This enables Agent OS to handle complex system operations while maintaining safety and reliability.

## Important Usage Notes

- **Always simulate before executing**: Never execute capabilities without running simulation first
- **Verify rollback procedures**: Test rollback procedures in non-production environments
- **Monitor executions closely**: Watch capability executions and be prepared to intervene
- **Document customizations**: Document any custom capabilities or modifications
- **Regular capability updates**: Keep capability definitions updated with system changes
- **Security review requirements**: Review security implications of all capability changes
- **Compliance validation**: Validate compliance requirements for all capability modifications
- **Team training**: Ensure team members understand capability safety and usage procedures

The capability framework transforms complex, risky operations into safe, manageable capabilities that can be confidently executed with full simulation, validation, and rollback support, enabling Agent OS to handle sophisticated system operations while maintaining safety and reliability.
