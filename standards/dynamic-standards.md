# Dynamic Standards Framework

## Context

Technical framework for implementing and managing dynamic, learning-based standards that adapt to user preferences while maintaining Agent OS structure and reliability.

## Overview

This document defines the technical architecture for how Agent OS standards evolve and adapt based on user behavior, ensuring personalization without sacrificing code quality or team collaboration effectiveness.

---

## Standards Resolution Engine

### Standards Hierarchy Processing
```yaml
Resolution Order (Higher Priority â†’ Lower Priority):
  1. Session Overrides (temporary user choices)
  2. Project-Specific Standards (current project requirements)
  3. Team Standards (collaborative agreements)  
  4. Learned User Preferences (personal adaptations)
  5. Base Agent OS Standards (framework defaults)

Processing Algorithm:
  for each standard_category in [code_style, architecture, quality]:
    result = base_standards[category]
    if learned_preferences[category] exists and confidence > threshold:
      result = merge(result, learned_preferences[category])
    if team_standards[category] exists:
      result = override(result, team_standards[category])
    if project_standards[category] exists:
      result = merge(result, project_standards[category])
    if session_overrides[category] exists:
      result = override(result, session_overrides[category])
    return result
```

### Confidence-Based Application
```yaml
Application Strategy by Confidence Level:

High Confidence (0.8-1.0):
  action: apply_automatically
  notification: silent_with_opt_out
  override_prompt: false
  examples:
    - "Applying 4-space indentation (96% consistency over 3 months)"
    - "Using React functional components (your standard pattern)"

Medium Confidence (0.6-0.8):
  action: apply_with_notification
  notification: explicit_with_explanation
  override_prompt: true
  examples:
    - "ðŸ’¡ Applying TypeScript interfaces (your 73% preference). Use types instead? (y/n)"
    - "ðŸŽ¯ Adding comprehensive error handling (your typical pattern). Minimal approach? (y/n)"

Low Confidence (0.3-0.6):
  action: suggest_only
  notification: optional_recommendation
  override_prompt: false
  examples:
    - "ðŸ’­ Consider: You've used Redux in similar features. Apply here?"
    - "ðŸ¤” Pattern detected: You often add caching to data-heavy components"

Uncertain (0.0-0.3):
  action: collect_data_only
  notification: none
  override_prompt: false
  behavior: observe and learn, no application
```

## Adaptive Standards Categories

### Code Style Standards
```yaml
Trackable Patterns:
  indentation:
    detection: "consistent_override_of_default"
    measurement: "spaces_or_tabs, size_preference"
    confidence_factors: [consistency_rate, override_frequency, time_period]
    
  naming_conventions:
    detection: "consistent_naming_pattern_usage"  
    measurement: "camelCase_vs_snake_case_vs_kebab-case"
    confidence_factors: [pattern_consistency, domain_specificity, team_alignment]
    
  string_quotes:
    detection: "quote_style_preference_in_code"
    measurement: "single_vs_double_quote_usage"
    confidence_factors: [consistency_across_projects, override_of_defaults]
    
  import_organization:
    detection: "import_statement_organization_pattern"
    measurement: "named_vs_default, grouping_strategy, sorting_preference"
    confidence_factors: [consistent_application, manual_reorganization_frequency]

## Learning Data Collection Framework

### Decision Tracking System
```yaml
Data Collection Points:
  spec_creation_decisions:
    - detail_level_preferences (minimal vs comprehensive)
    - section_customizations (added, modified, removed)
    - architectural_choices (frameworks, patterns, libraries)
    - quality_requirements (testing, docs, performance)
    
  implementation_decisions:
    - code_style_choices (indentation, naming, organization)
    - architectural_implementations (actual vs suggested patterns)
    - library_selections (user choices vs recommendations)
    - refactoring_patterns (when and how user improves code)

    - review_focus_areas (what user emphasizes in reviews)
    - deployment_approaches (user's preferred release strategies)
    - collaboration_patterns (pairing, async review, documentation)

Decision Recording Format:
  {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "category": "code_style",
    "decision_type": "indentation_preference",  
    "context": {
      "project_type": "react_typescript",
      "file_type": "component",
      "team_size": 1
    },
    "user_choice": "4_spaces",
    "default_suggestion": "2_spaces",
    "confidence_before": 0.0,
    "explicit_override": true,
    "success_indicators": ["no_further_changes", "consistent_usage"]
  }
```

### Pattern Recognition Algorithms
```yaml
Consistency Detection:
  algorithm: "temporal_consistency_analysis"
  inputs: [decision_history, time_weights, context_similarity]
  output: confidence_score
  
  calculation:
    consistency_score = similar_decisions_count / total_decisions_in_context
    recency_weight = exponential_decay(days_since_decision)
    context_match_weight = similarity_score(current_context, historical_context)
    final_confidence = (consistency_score * recency_weight * context_match_weight)

Success Correlation Analysis:
  algorithm: "outcome_correlation_tracking"
  inputs: [decision_patterns, project_outcomes, satisfaction_indicators]
  output: pattern_effectiveness_score
  
  success_indicators:
    - project_completion_rate
    - code_review_feedback_reduction
    - bug_report_frequency
    - user_satisfaction_ratings
    - time_to_completion_improvements

  output: preference_stability_score
  
  stability_factors:
    - consistency_over_time
    - context_independence
    - explicit_confirmations
    - successful_outcomes_correlation
```

## Standards Application Engine

### Dynamic Standards Generation
```yaml
Personal Standards Compilation:
  process:
    1. Load base Agent OS standards
    2. Query user's learned preferences with confidence filtering
    3. Apply team/project overrides where applicable
    4. Generate personalized standards files
    5. Cache compiled standards for session use
    
  output_files:
    - .agent-os/learning/compiled-standards/
      â”œâ”€â”€ personal-code-style.md
      â”œâ”€â”€ personal-best-practices.md  
      â”œâ”€â”€ personal-architecture-guide.md
      â””â”€â”€ personal-quality-standards.md

Real-Time Standards Resolution:
  trigger_points:
    - Spec generation requests
    - Code creation guidance
    - Architecture decision points
    - Quality review checkpoints
    
  resolution_process:
    1. Identify applicable standards categories
    2. Query learned preferences for relevant patterns
    3. Apply confidence-based filtering
    4. Merge with base/team/project standards
    5. Present personalized guidance
    6. Record user response for further learning
```

### Contextual Standards Application
```yaml
Project Context Awareness:
  factors:
    - project_type: ["web_app", "mobile_app", "api_service", "data_pipeline"]
    - team_size: [solo, small_team, large_team]
    - technology_stack: [languages, frameworks, tools]
    - domain: ["e-commerce", "fintech", "healthcare", "education"]
    - complexity: [simple, moderate, complex, enterprise]
    
  context_influence_on_standards:
    code_style:
      - team_size affects consistency requirements
      - domain affects naming convention importance
      - complexity affects documentation requirements
      
    architecture:
      - project_type influences pattern recommendations
      - team_size affects architectural complexity appropriateness
      - technology_stack constrains available patterns
      
    quality:
      - domain affects security and testing requirements
      - complexity influences code review depth needed
      - team_size affects automation vs manual process balance

Dynamic Context Adaptation:
  # Example: E-commerce project gets enhanced security standards
  if project_domain == "e-commerce":
    quality_standards.security_requirements += [
      "payment_data_encryption",
      "pci_compliance_checks", 
      "input_sanitization_validation"
    ]
    architecture_standards.patterns += [
      "secure_payment_processing",
      "audit_logging_for_transactions",
      "rate_limiting_for_apis"
    ]
```

## Team Collaboration Integration

### Shared Learning Mechanisms
```yaml
Team Pattern Aggregation:
  process:
    1. Collect individual team member preferences
    2. Identify areas of consensus vs divergence  
    3. Propose team standards for consensus areas
    4. Allow individual preferences for non-consensus areas
    5. Track team standard effectiveness over time
    
  consensus_detection:
    high_consensus: >80% team member alignment
    moderate_consensus: 60-80% alignment  
    low_consensus: <60% alignment
    
  team_standard_proposal:
    for areas with high_consensus:
      propose as team standard
    for areas with moderate_consensus:
      suggest discussion and decision
    for areas with low_consensus:
      maintain individual preferences

Individual vs Team Balance:
  team_override_categories:
    - code_style (for consistency in shared codebase)
    - git_workflow (for collaboration efficiency)
    - deployment_process (for operational consistency)
    - security_standards (for compliance requirements)
    
  individual_preference_categories:
    - spec_detail_level (personal working style)
    - documentation_approach (individual strengths)
    - task_breakdown_granularity (personal productivity)
    - personal_quality_bars (individual standards)
```

### Collaborative Learning Benefits
```yaml
Cross-Team Pattern Sharing:
  mechanism: "anonymized_pattern_insights"
  benefits:
    - "Teams using pattern X report 23% fewer bugs"
    - "Architectural approach Y shows 15% faster development"
    - "Quality standard Z correlates with higher user satisfaction"
    
  privacy_protection:
    - No individual identifiable data shared
    - Aggregate statistics only
    - Opt-in participation in pattern sharing
    - Local-first with optional anonymized insights

Team Efficiency Improvements:
  onboarding_acceleration:
    - New team members inherit successful team patterns
    - Reduced learning curve for team standards
    - Automatic adaptation to team collaboration style
    
  consistency_benefits:
    - Reduced code review friction from style differences
    - Faster integration of individual contributions
    - Improved code maintainability across team members
```

## Standards Evolution Management

### Version Control for Standards
```yaml
Standards Change Tracking:
  versioning_system:
    - Track when standards change and why
    - Maintain history of learned preference evolution
    - Allow rollback of unsuccessful adaptations
    - Document correlation between changes and outcomes
    
  change_log_example:
    - "2024-01-15: Increased personal test coverage target to 85% (confidence: 0.91)"
    - "2024-01-20: Added TypeScript interface preference (confidence: 0.73)"  
    - "2024-02-01: Adopted team eslint config over personal indentation (team override)"

Adaptation Rollback Mechanisms:
  triggers_for_rollback:
    - Decreased project success rate
    - User explicit dissatisfaction  
    - Increased error rates
    - Team collaboration friction
    
  rollback_process:
    1. Identify problematic standard change
    2. Measure impact of reverting change
    3. Notify user of proposed rollback with reasoning
    4. Apply rollback and monitor improvement
    5. Update learning algorithm confidence adjustments
```

### Continuous Learning Improvement
```yaml
Learning Algorithm Refinement:
  feedback_loops:
    - User satisfaction with applied standards
    - Project success correlation with standards
    - Time savings from personalized standards
    - Error reduction from adapted standards
    
  algorithm_improvements:
    - Adjust confidence thresholds based on accuracy
    - Refine pattern recognition based on false positives
    - Improve context awareness based on user feedback
    - Enhance team vs individual balance optimization

Meta-Learning Capabilities:
  learning_about_learning:
    - Which types of preferences are most stable over time
    - Which context factors most influence standard effectiveness
    - How quickly users adapt to new patterns
    - What confidence levels optimize user satisfaction vs accuracy
    
  self_improving_system:
    - Automatically adjust learning parameters based on outcomes
    - Improve pattern recognition accuracy over time
    - Better predict when to suggest vs automatically apply standards
    - Enhanced understanding of individual vs team preference balance
```
