# Agent Orchestration Patterns

This document defines proven patterns for coordinating multiple agents across different types of development workflows. These patterns enable the workflow orchestrator to automatically select optimal coordination strategies based on task complexity, dependencies, and resource availability.

## Overview

Agent orchestration patterns provide structured approaches for coordinating multiple intelligent agents to achieve complex development goals. Each pattern defines specific coordination strategies, communication protocols, and optimization approaches that can be automatically applied based on workflow analysis.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Pattern Composability**: All patterns must be composable and adaptable for specific workflow needs
- **Graceful Degradation**: All patterns must degrade gracefully to simpler coordination when resources are limited
- **User Transparency**: Users should understand which coordination pattern is being used and why
- **Learning Integration**: All patterns should contribute data for improving future pattern selection
- **Safety Measures**: All patterns must include appropriate error handling and rollback capabilities

These orchestration patterns enable Agent OS to automatically coordinate multiple intelligent agents in optimal ways based on workflow complexity, resource availability, and user preferences, transforming manual agent management into intelligent, adaptive coordination that maximizes efficiency while maintaining reliability and user control.
