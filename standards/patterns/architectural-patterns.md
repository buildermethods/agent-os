## Frontend Architecture Patterns

### Component-Based Architecture (React/Vue)
```yaml
Pattern: "component_architecture"
Best For: ["web_apps", "dashboards", "user_interfaces"]
Complexity: Medium
Tech Stack: ["react", "vue", "angular"]

Core Principles:
  - Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose
  - Composability: Components can be combined to create complex UIs
  - Reusability: Components can be reused across different parts of the app
  - State Management: Clear patterns for data flow and state handling

Implementation Structure:
  components/
  ├── ui/              # Reusable UI components
  ├── features/        # Feature-specific components
  ├── layout/          # Layout and navigation components
  └── pages/           # Route-level page components

State Management Options:

## Pattern Selection Guidelines

### Choosing Architecture Patterns

#### Project Size Considerations
- **Small Projects**: Single database, monolithic deployment, simple caching
- **Medium Projects**: Layered architecture, database scaling, CDN integration  
- **Large Projects**: Microservices, event-driven patterns, complex caching

#### Team Size Impact
- **Solo Developer**: Favor simplicity, proven patterns, minimal overhead
- **Small Team (2-5)**: Balance complexity with capability, shared standards
- **Large Team (6+)**: Microservices, clear boundaries, autonomous deployment

#### Performance Requirements
- **Low Latency**: Caching strategies, event-driven architecture
- **High Throughput**: Horizontal scaling, load balancing, database optimization
- **Variable Load**: Serverless, auto-scaling, efficient resource utilization

### Integration Recommendations

#### Frontend + Backend Patterns
- **JAMstack + Serverless**: Great for content sites with dynamic features
- **SPA + REST API**: Traditional web application approach
- **Micro-frontends + Microservices**: Large-scale enterprise applications

#### Database + Caching Combinations
- **Single DB + Redis**: Most web applications
- **CQRS + Event Store**: Complex business domains
- **Database per Service**: Microservices architecture

These architectural patterns provide guidance for creating scalable, maintainable applications while allowing customization based on specific project needs and constraints.
