# Context Optimization Standards

## Context

Smart default behaviors and optimization guidelines for Agent OS's intelligent context management system.

## Overview

This document defines the standards for context optimization features, including compression, deduplication, caching, and intelligent recommendations. These standards ensure consistent behavior while allowing for progressive enhancement and user customization.

## Core Optimization Principles

### 1. Progressive Enhancement Philosophy
- **Start Conservative**: Begin with full content, gradually introduce optimizations
- **Learn and Adapt**: Adjust behavior based on user feedback and patterns
- **Preserve Choice**: Always allow users to override automatic behaviors
- **Show Value**: Demonstrate concrete benefits through metrics

### 2. User-Centric Approach
- **Guided Discovery**: Help users find optimizations naturally through usage
- **Clear Communication**: Explain why optimizations help and how they work
- **Respect Preferences**: Remember and honor user choices across sessions
- **Minimize Friction**: Reduce cognitive overhead while maximizing value

### 3. Quality Assurance
- **Accuracy First**: Never sacrifice content accuracy for optimization
- **Transparent Process**: Show what's being optimized and why
- **Reversible Actions**: Allow expansion of compressed content on demand
- **Fallback Ready**: Gracefully handle optimization failures

---

## Compression Standards

### Content Size Thresholds
```yaml
Compression Triggers:
  large_file: >2000 tokens
  very_large_file: >5000 tokens
  massive_file: >10000 tokens

Compression Levels:
  light: 10-25% reduction (headers, summaries, redundant examples)
  moderate: 25-50% reduction (detailed examples, verbose explanations)
  aggressive: 50-75% reduction (keep only essential content)
```

### Content Type Priorities
```yaml
High Priority (preserve fully):
  - Action items and requirements
  - Decision points and rationale
  - Code examples and configurations
  - Error messages and diagnostics

Medium Priority (compress moderately):
  - Explanatory text and context
  - Process descriptions
  - Background information
  - Non-critical examples

Low Priority (compress aggressively):
  - Boilerplate text
  - Repeated information
  - Verbose examples
  - Historical context
```

### Compression Strategies by File Type

#### Specification Files (spec.md, technical-spec.md)
- **Light Compression**: Preserve all requirements, compress examples
- **Smart Sections**: Extract user stories, acceptance criteria, technical details
- **Pattern**: Keep structure, summarize verbose explanations

#### Documentation (README.md, mission.md, tech-stack.md)
- **Moderate Compression**: Extract key points, summarize details  
- **Focus Areas**: Goals, constraints, decisions, current status
- **Pattern**: Headers + bullet points + key decisions

#### Code Style Guides (code-style.md, best-practices.md)
- **Context-Aware**: Extract only relevant language/framework rules
- **Smart Filtering**: Show applicable sections based on current task
- **Pattern**: Rules + examples for current context only

#### Task Files (tasks.md)
- **Minimal Compression**: Preserve task details and dependencies
- **Smart Extraction**: Focus on current/next tasks in sequence
- **Pattern**: Task details + success criteria + dependencies

## Deduplication Standards

### Content Identification
```yaml
Fingerprinting Strategy:
  - Hash-based: MD5 for exact content matches
  - Semantic: Detect similar content with different formatting
  - Temporal: Track content age and modification timestamps
  - Usage: Monitor access frequency and patterns

Cache Management:
  - Session Cache: Active for current workflow session
  - Persistent Cache: Cross-session for frequently accessed content
  - Smart Expiry: Clear based on file modification times
  - Memory Limits: Manage cache size to prevent bloat
```

### Deduplication Rules
```yaml
Exact Matches:
  - Skip identical content completely
  - Show cache hit notification with token savings
  - Verify content freshness before serving cached version

Partial Matches:
  - Identify overlapping sections
  - Extract only new/changed content  
  - Reference previous context for duplicate sections

Similar Content:
  - Detect content variations (formatting, minor updates)
  - Highlight differences if significant
  - Use cached version for unchanged portions
```

---

## Intelligent Recommendations Standards

### Suggestion Timing
```yaml
When to Suggest:
  - After detecting 3+ duplicate fetches of same file
  - When large files (>2000 tokens) are accessed repeatedly  
  - During patterns that indicate workflow optimization opportunities
  - At natural break points (end of tasks, start of new workflows)

When NOT to Suggest:
  - During active task execution
  - When user is clearly focused on specific content
  - More than once per 10-minute period
  - If previous suggestion was declined recently
```

### Recommendation Categories
```yaml
Performance Optimizations:
  - Context compression for large files
  - Deduplication for repeated access
  - Caching for frequently used content
  - Preloading for predictable patterns

Workflow Improvements:
  - Related content suggestions
  - Pattern-based next steps
  - Efficiency shortcuts
  - Time-saving automation

Learning Opportunities:
  - Feature education for power users
  - Best practice suggestions
  - Advanced optimization options
  - Team collaboration enhancements
```

### Suggestion Format Standards
```yaml
Structure:
  1. Context: Brief description of detected pattern
  2. Recommendation: Specific, actionable suggestion
  3. Benefit: Clear explanation of value/savings
  4. Action: Simple way to enable/try the optimization

Examples:
  "ðŸ“Š Pattern detected: You've accessed mission.md 4 times (3,200 tokens total)
   ðŸ’¡ Recommendation: Cache mission document for this session
   â†’ Saves ~2,400 tokens on future accesses
   â†’ Enable caching? (y/n)"

Tone Guidelines:
  - Helpful, not pushy
  - Specific benefits, not vague promises  
  - Easy to understand and act upon
  - Respectful of user's time and attention
```

## Learning and Adaptation Standards

### User Preference Tracking
```yaml
Track User Responses:
  - Accepted vs declined suggestions
  - Preferred compression levels
  - Content type preferences
  - Timing preferences for suggestions

Learn Patterns:
  - File access sequences
  - Project type workflows
  - Content detail preferences
  - Optimization acceptance rates

Adapt Behavior:
  - Adjust suggestion frequency based on acceptance rate
  - Customize compression levels to user preference
  - Modify recommendation timing based on workflow patterns
  - Personalize content prioritization
```

- New features introduce themselves progressively
- No breaking changes to existing agent interfaces

### Performance Requirements
- Optimization decisions must complete in <100ms
- Cache operations should not impact session startup
- Memory usage should stay within reasonable bounds
- Network requests should not be required for basic optimizations

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when optimizations fail
- Clear user communication about any issues
- Automatic fallback to non-optimized behavior
- User option to retry or disable problematic features

### Privacy and Security
- No external data transmission for optimization features
- Local-only learning and pattern storage
- User control over all data collection
- Easy data clearing and reset options
