## Recommendation Engine

### Configuration Categories

#### 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**
```
📊 Analysis: You run large codebases with 1000+ files
💡 Recommendation: Enable context warmup for 60% faster startup
→ Current: 15-20s task initialization
→ With warmup: 6-8s task initialization  
→ Configure automatically? (y/n)

⚙️ Suggested config.yml changes:
context_intelligence:
  warmup_enabled: true
  project_complexity_threshold: high
  preload_common_files: true
```

#### 🎯 **Workflow Enhancements**
```
📈 Pattern Detected: You create 3-4 specs per week
💡 Recommendation: Enable smart spec templates for your project type
→ Auto-fills common sections based on your patterns
→ Reduces spec creation time by ~40%
→ Would you like me to set this up? (y/n)

🔧 Configuration impact:
project_types:
  your_project:
    spec_templates: enabled
    auto_fill_preferences: learned
    standards: personalized
```

#### 🤝 **Team Collaboration**
```
👥 Team Analysis: 4 developers using Agent OS
💡 Recommendation: Enable shared learning and team standards
→ Share successful patterns across team
→ Consistent code style and practices
→ Faster onboarding for new team members
→ Set up team configuration? (y/n)

📋 Team benefits:
- Shared optimization patterns
- Consistent workflow standards  
- Collaborative efficiency metrics
- Team-wide best practice sharing
```

### Recommendation Delivery Strategies

#### Progressive Discovery
```yaml
Week 1-2: Basic Usage Analysis
  - Monitor fundamental patterns
  - Suggest obvious efficiency wins
  - Introduce core optimization concepts
  - Build user trust and engagement

Week 3-4: Feature Introduction
  - Recommend relevant advanced features
  - Show specific benefits for user's workflow
  - Provide guided feature trials
  - Collect feedback on feature usefulness

Month 2+: Advanced Optimization
  - Suggest sophisticated workflow improvements
  - Provide team coordination enhancements
  - Recommend custom configuration profiles
  - Enable power user features
```

#### Contextual Timing
```yaml
Best Times for Suggestions:
  - End of successful workflows (positive association)
  - During natural workflow breaks
  - When user encounters efficiency blockers
  - After demonstrating clear value with simpler optimizations

Avoid Suggesting During:
  - Active problem-solving or debugging
  - Time-pressured situations
  - Failed workflow attempts
  - Recent suggestion declines
```

## Intelligent Configuration Generation

### Smart Defaults Based on Patterns
```yaml
Detected Pattern: Frontend React Developer
Suggested Configuration:
  project_types:
    frontend_react:
      instructions: ~/.agent-os/project_types/frontend/instructions
      standards: ~/.agent-os/project_types/frontend/standards
      preferred_agents: [context-fetcher, file-creator, test-runner]
      optimization_level: moderate
      
  context_intelligence:
    mode: guided
    compression_preferred: true
    javascript_focus: true
    
  workflow_preferences:
    spec_detail_level: medium
    test_first_approach: true
    component_focused: true
```

### Adaptive Configuration Updates
```yaml
Learning Cycle:
  1. Monitor user responses to current config
  2. Track workflow success rates and satisfaction
  3. Identify configuration pain points
  4. Propose incremental improvements
  5. Test and validate changes
  6. Refine based on results

Examples:
  "Your spec creation is 23% faster since enabling templates.
   → Try auto-generating task breakdowns next? (saves 5-8 min per spec)"

  "You've accepted 90% of compression suggestions.
   → Enable auto-compression with notification? (y/n)"
```

## Configuration Recommendations Format
