## Personal Fork: Agent OS as Claude Code Plugin

**This is a personalized fork** of the incredible [Agent OS](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os) created by [Brian Casel](https://buildermethods.com). I've customized it to fit my specific development workflow and preferences.

### What is Agent OS?

Agent OS transforms AI coding agents from confused interns into productive developers. With structured workflows that capture your standards, your stack, and the unique details of your codebase, Agent OS gives your agents the specs they need to ship quality code on the first try—not the fifth.

For the **original, production-ready version** that works with Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI tools, visit:

- **Original Repository**: [buildermethods/agent-os](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os)
- **Official Documentation**: [buildermethods.com/agent-os](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os)

## My Customizations

I work exclusively with **Claude Code** and have adapted Agent OS to better fit my personal workflow:

### Key Changes

1. **Claude Code Plugin Architecture**
   - Transformed Agent OS into a Claude Code plugin instead of per-project installation
   - No need to reinstall in each project—install once, use everywhere
   - Leverages Claude Code's native plugin system

2. **Custom Commands**
   - Added commands I frequently use in my workflow
   - Tailored to my specific development patterns

3. **Implementation Style**
   - Prefer working on one group of tasks at a time with full control
   - Modified workflows to match my sequential, focused approach
   - Updated agent interactions to align with how I work

4. **Inspired by Claude Code Plugins**
   - Drew architectural inspiration from [anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main)
   - Adapted patterns from the official Claude Code plugin repository

## Important Disclaimer

**This fork is NOT adapted for everyone.**

This is a highly personalized version that reflects my specific:

- Development workflow preferences
- Tool choices (Claude Code only)
- Implementation style
- Project structure habits

I'm sharing this publicly to:

- Show how I use Brian Casel's incredible tool
- Provide inspiration for others who want to customize Agent OS
- Demonstrate one way to adapt Agent OS to specific workflows

**If you're new to Agent OS**, I strongly recommend starting with the [official version](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os) and Brian's excellent documentation.
