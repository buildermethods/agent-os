## Enhance your spec-driven development with smart standards.

[Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os) captures the tribal knowledge from your codebase and deploys it to your AI coding tools exactly when needed. Document your standards once, then let Agent OS inject the right conventions into the right context—so every spec and every implementation follows your patterns.

Works alongside Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, and other AI tools. Any language, any framework.

**Core capabilities:**

- **Discover Standards** — Extract patterns and conventions from your codebase into documented standards
- **Deploy Standards** — Intelligently inject relevant standards based on what you're building
- **Shape Spec** — Create better plans that lead to better builds
- **Index Standards** — Keep your standards organized and discoverable
