## Your system for spec-driven agentic development.

This project is basically to modify the Agent OS project (.vibe/agent-os) to have a QA Agent OS

QA Agent OS transforms AI coding agents from confused interns into productive QA Engeniers. With structured workflows that capture your standards, your stack, and the unique details of your codebase, QA Agent OS gives your agents the specs they need to ship quality QA Test, analise bugs , follow workflows on the first try—not the fifth.

Use it with:

✅ Claude Code, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool.

✅ New products or established codebases.

✅ Big features, small fixes, or anything in between.

✅ Any language or framework.
