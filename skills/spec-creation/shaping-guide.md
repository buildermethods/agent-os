# Spec Shaping Guide

Detailed guidance for the requirements gathering phase of specification creation.

## Overview

Spec shaping transforms a vague feature idea into documented, validated requirements through structured questioning and analysis.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Feature Description Acquisition

**If description provided**: Use it immediately to start the spec.

**If no description**:

1. Read `agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
2. Find next planned feature
3. Present to user: "The roadmap shows [X] is next. Go with that or provide your own?"
4. **STOP and wait for user response**

### 2. Folder Initialization

Create dated spec folder structure:

```bash
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
SPEC_NAME="kebab-case-feature-name"
DATED_SPEC_NAME="${TODAY}-${SPEC_NAME}"
SPEC_PATH="agent-os/specs/$DATED_SPEC_NAME"

mkdir -p $SPEC_PATH/planning
mkdir -p $SPEC_PATH/planning/visuals
mkdir -p $SPEC_PATH/implementation
```

**Naming conventions**:

- Use YYYY-MM-DD date prefix
- Feature name in kebab-case
- Example: `2025-11-16-user-authentication`

### 3. Product Context Analysis

Before asking questions, read these files to understand context:

**`agent-os/product/mission.md`**:

- Product's overall mission and purpose
- Target users and primary use cases
- Core problems being solved
- How users benefit

**`agent-os/product/roadmap.md`**:

- Already completed features
- Current product state
- Where this feature fits
- Related features for context

**`agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`**:

- Technologies and frameworks in use
- Technical constraints
- Available libraries and tools

**Why this matters**:

- Your questions become more relevant
- You identify existing features to reuse
- You ensure feature aligns with product goals
- You understand user expectations

### 4. Question Generation Strategy

Generate 4-8 numbered questions that:

- Propose sensible assumptions based on best practices
- Make it easy for user to confirm or provide alternatives
- Include specific suggestions they can respond to
- Cover functional requirements, constraints, and exclusions

**Question framing patterns**:

- "I assume [specific assumption]. Is that correct, or [alternative]?"
- "I'm thinking [specific approach]. Should we [alternative]?"
- "For [aspect], I suggest [option]. Does that work, or would you prefer [other option]?"

**Question categories to cover**:

1. Core functionality (what the feature does)
2. User interactions (how users engage with it)
3. Data and state (what's stored, how it persists)
4. Integration points (how it connects to existing features)
5. Constraints and limitations (performance, security, etc.)
6. Edge cases and error handling
7. What's explicitly NOT included (scope boundaries)

**Always include at end**:

**Reusability question**:

```bash
Are there existing features in your codebase with similar patterns we should reference?
For example:
- Similar interface elements or UI components to re-use
- Comparable page layouts or navigation patterns
- Related backend logic or service objects
- Existing models or controllers with similar functionality

Please provide file/folder paths or names of these features if they exist.
```

**Visual assets request**:

```bash
Do you have any design mockups, wireframes, or screenshots that could help guide the development?

If yes, please place them in: `[spec-path]/planning/visuals/`

Use descriptive file names like:
- homepage-mockup.png
- dashboard-wireframe.jpg
- lofi-form-layout.png
- mobile-view.png
- existing-ui-screenshot.png
```

**Then STOP and wait for user answers.**

### 5. Answer Processing

When user responds:

**Store answers**: Keep exact wording, don't interpret or rephrase.

**MANDATORY visual check** (even if user said "no visuals"):

```bash
# Users often add files without mentioning them!
ls -la [spec-path]/planning/visuals/ 2>/dev/null | grep -E '\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|pdf)$' || echo "No visual files found"
```

**If visual files found**:

1. Use Read tool on EACH file
2. Document design elements: layouts, components, colors, typography, spacing
3. Note user flows and interaction patterns
4. Check filename for fidelity indicators:
   - "lofi", "lo-fi", "wireframe", "sketch", "rough" → low-fidelity
   - High-fidelity if detailed colors, final copy, polished design

**If user mentioned similar features**:

- Note the paths/names they provided
- DO NOT explore them yourself (saves time)
- Document for spec-writer to reference later

### 6. Follow-up Questions (If Needed)

Determine if follow-ups needed based on:

**Visual-triggered**:

- Visuals found but user didn't mention them → acknowledge and analyze
- Low-fidelity filenames → clarify if wireframes or exact designs
- Visual shows features not discussed → ask about them
- Discrepancy between answers and visuals → resolve it

**Reusability-triggered**:

- User didn't provide similar features but spec seems common → ask
- Provided paths seem incomplete → ask for related logic/services

**Answer-triggered**:

- Vague requirements → ask for specifics
- Missing technical details → ask for clarification
- Unclear scope boundaries → define them

**Keep follow-ups minimal**: 1-3 questions maximum.

**Format**:

```bash
Based on your answers [and the visual files I found], I have a few follow-up questions:

1. [Specific question]
2. [Another if needed]

Please provide these additional details.
```

**Then STOP and wait.**

### 7. Requirements Documentation

After all questions answered, save to `[spec-path]/planning/requirements.md`:

**Use this exact structure**:

```markdown
# Spec Requirements: [Spec Name]

## Initial Description
[User's original description verbatim]

## Requirements Discussion

### First Round Questions

**Q1:** [Question you asked]
**Answer:** [User's exact answer]

**Q2:** [Second question]
**Answer:** [User's exact answer]

[Continue for all questions]

### Existing Code to Reference

**Similar Features Identified:**
- Feature: [Name] - Path: `[path from user]`
- Components to reuse: [what user said]
- Backend logic to reference: [what user said]

[OR if none]
No similar existing features identified for reference.

### Follow-up Questions
[If any asked]

**Follow-up 1:** [Question]
**Answer:** [User's answer]

## Visual Assets

### Files Provided:
[Based on bash check, NOT user statement]
- `filename.png`: [What you observed analyzing it]
- `filename2.jpg`: [Key elements you saw]

### Visual Insights:
- [Design patterns identified]
- [User flow implications]
- [UI components shown]
- [Fidelity level: high-fidelity mockup / low-fidelity wireframe]

[OR if bash found none]
No visual assets provided.

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements
- [Core functionality from answers]
- [User actions enabled]
- [Data to be managed]

### Reusability Opportunities
- [Components that might exist based on user input]
- [Backend patterns to investigate]
- [Similar features to model after]

### Scope Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- [What will be built]

**Out of Scope:**
- [What won't be built]
- [Future enhancements mentioned]

### Technical Considerations
- [Integration points mentioned]
- [Existing system constraints]
- [Technology preferences stated]
- [Similar code patterns to follow]
```

**Critical rules**:

- Use user's exact words for answers
- Base "Visual Assets" on bash check, not user claims
- Document fidelity level of visuals
- Note paths to similar features but don't explore them
- Keep it factual, not interpretive

## Best Practices

### DO

✅ Always check visuals folder via bash after receiving answers
✅ Ask about existing similar features for reusability
✅ Propose assumptions to make it easy for user to confirm
✅ Document user's exact answers, not your interpretations
✅ Analyze every visual file with Read tool
✅ Check filenames for fidelity indicators
✅ Keep follow-ups minimal (1-3 max)
✅ Stop and wait for user responses at each interaction point

### DON'T

❌ Skip the mandatory visual check
❌ Rephrase or interpret user answers
❌ Explore existing code yourself during shaping (save for writing phase)
❌ Ask too many follow-up questions (overwhelming)
❌ Proceed without user response when you asked a question
❌ Write technical specifications yet (that's the writing phase)
❌ Trust user's claim about visuals (they often forget files they added)

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User says "no visuals" but files exist

```bash
# You asked about visuals, user said "no"
# But you MUST check anyway:
ls -la agent-os/specs/2025-11-16-feature/planning/visuals/

# Finds: mockup.png, wireframe.jpg

# Your response:
"I found mockup.png and wireframe.jpg in the visuals folder.
Let me analyze these to better understand the design requirements."

# Then use Read tool on each file
```

### Scenario 2: Low-fidelity wireframe filenames

```bash
# Files found: lofi-dashboard.png, rough-sketch-form.jpg

# Your follow-up:
"I notice you've provided lofi-dashboard.png and rough-sketch-form.jpg
which appear to be wireframes or low-fidelity mockups. Should we treat
these as layout and structure guides rather than exact design
specifications, using our application's existing styling instead?"
```

### Scenario 3: User mentions similar feature

```bash
# User answer: "Yeah, we have a similar form at app/views/posts/new.html.erb"

# Document it in requirements.md:
**Similar Features Identified:**
- Feature: Post creation form - Path: `app/views/posts/new.html.erb`
- Components to reuse: form layout and validation patterns

# DO NOT read the file yourself during shaping
# The spec-writer will explore it during writing phase
```
