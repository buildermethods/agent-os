Perfect! Now for the final phase - the review phase to assess execution quality:

‚è∫ peer-review(Task: Review PEER execution (using peer-review agent)

             Prompt: Review PEER execution

             STATE_KEY: peer.spec.walcommitter-operation-support.cycle.1

             The unified state at STATE_KEY contains all phase outputs:
             - Plan at phases.plan.output
             - Execution at phases.execute.output
             - Expression at phases.express.output

             Assess quality and provide recommendations, then:
             1. Read the current state from STATE_KEY
             2. Update phases.review with insights:
               - Set status to 'completed'
               - Add output with quality score, strengths, improvements
               - Add completed_at timestamp
             3. Update metadata.status to 'REVIEWING' then 'COMPLETED'
             4. Update metadata.current_phase to 'review'
             5. Write the updated state back to STATE_KEY

             The unified state follows the schema at @~/.agent-os/instructions/meta/unified_state_schema.md)

     Quality Assessment

     Overall Score: HIGH (91/100)

     Strengths

     Excellent Root Cause Analysis: The planning and execution phases demonstrated exceptional technical analysis, identifying the exact issue - WAL messages contain an op field that the committer ignores, always defaulting to put operations.

     Well-Structured Technical Solution: The specification includes a clean switch-case approach for operation handling with proper backward compatibility planning, ensuring existing deployments won't break.

     Comprehensive Risk Assessment: All phases included specific risk identification with concrete mitigations, particularly around breaking changes and performance impact.

     Clear Implementation Strategy: The task breakdown provides actionable steps with clear dependencies and success criteria.

     Professional Documentation Standards: All deliverables follow Agent OS patterns with proper file structure, naming conventions, and cross-references.

     Areas for Improvement

     Performance Analysis: While performance impact was considered, the specification could benefit from more detailed benchmarking plans and specific performance targets.

     Testing Completeness: The testing strategy covers operation types but could include load testing scenarios and more edge cases for malformed operation fields.

     Migration Considerations: While backward compatibility is planned, there could be more detail about migration paths for existing deployments.

     Insights Collected

     What Worked Well

     - Thorough Codebase Analysis: Examining actual WAL templates and test files revealed the root cause quickly and accurately
     - Backward Compatibility Focus: Prioritizing compatibility prevented potential production issues
     - Professional Documentation: Following Agent OS standards made the spec immediately actionable
     - Clear Technical Approach: Switch-case logic provides clean separation without performance overhead

     Patterns Identified

     - Success Pattern: Starting with code analysis before spec writing leads to more accurate technical solutions
     - Success Pattern: Comprehensive risk assessment with specific mitigations builds confidence in implementation
     - Improvement Opportunity: Performance analysis could be more detailed in planning phases
     - Improvement Opportunity: Edge case consideration could happen earlier in the process

     Recommendations

     For This Deliverable

     - Consider adding performance benchmarks before/after implementation to validate no regression
     - Add integration tests with existing WAL writer pipelines to ensure end-to-end functionality
     - Document migration path for any existing deployments that might be affected

     For Future Cycles

     - Include performance impact analysis in planning phase for infrastructure-level changes
     - Create reusable patterns for operation handling across templates to prevent similar issues
     - Consider utility functions for operation validation and sanitization

  ‚úÖ Express phase completed
  ‚úÖ Review phase completed

  Quality Score: 91/100 (HIGH)

  The specification for WAL committer operation support has been successfully created with comprehensive analysis, technical design, and implementation roadmap. The issue has been identified as the kv_cache_process function ignoring operation types from WAL messages, and a clear solution has been designed with
  proper backward compatibility.

  All outputs stored in NATS KV under: peer.spec.walcommitter-operation-support.cycle.1

  Ready to proceed with implementation using the created task breakdown.
