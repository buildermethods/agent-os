> Spec: Refactor Agent OS Slash Commands for Claude Code Best Practices
> Created: 2025-07-29
> GitHub Issue: #38
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Refactor Agent OS slash commands to follow Claude Code architectural best practices by converting monolithic instruction files into lightweight orchestrators that use bash execution and file imports, eliminating performance warnings and improving maintainability.

## User Stories

### Performance Improvement for AI Developers

As an Agent OS user working with Claude Code, I want slash commands to load quickly without performance warnings, so that my AI-assisted development workflow remains efficient and responsive.

Current workflow: Execute `/execute-tasks` command → Claude Code loads 57k character instruction file → Performance warning appears → AI processes slowly
Desired workflow: Execute `/execute-tasks` command → Lightweight orchestrator loads → Dynamic context gathering via bash → Fast AI processing

### Maintainable Command Architecture

As an Agent OS maintainer, I want slash commands to follow modular architecture patterns, so that I can easily update, test, and extend individual components without affecting the entire system.

Current state: Single 57k character execute-tasks.md file contains all logic, making updates risky and testing difficult
Desired state: Modular components with clear separation of concerns, enabling targeted updates and comprehensive testing

### Aligned Implementation Patterns

As a Claude Code user, I want Agent OS commands to follow Claude Code's intended architectural patterns, so that I can confidently use the framework knowing it adheres to tool best practices.

Current issue: Agent OS commands violate Claude Code documentation guidelines for lightweight command design
Goal: Commands demonstrate proper use of bash execution (`!` prefix) and file imports (`@` prefix) as recommended by Claude Code

## Spec Scope

1. **Execute-Tasks Command Refactor** - Convert 57k character execute-tasks.md into lightweight orchestrator with modular bash scripts
2. **Dynamic Context Loading** - Implement bash scripts for workspace hygiene checking and project memory refresh
3. **Modular Instruction Architecture** - Split detailed workflow instructions into importable modules under 5k characters each
4. **Performance Optimization** - Eliminate Claude Code performance warnings through proper file size management
5. **Pattern Standardization** - Update all Agent OS slash commands to follow the new lightweight orchestrator pattern

## Out of Scope

- Changing Agent OS workflow functionality or user experience
- Modifying the core Agent OS instruction files (plan-product.md, create-spec.md, analyze-product.md)
- Creating new slash commands beyond the existing set
- Altering the Agent OS installation or setup process

## Expected Deliverable

1. Execute-tasks.md reduced from 57k to under 5k characters while maintaining all functionality
2. All Agent OS slash commands load without Claude Code performance warnings
3. Modular bash script architecture for dynamic operations (hygiene checks, context loading, validation)
4. Complete preservation of existing Agent OS workflow capabilities and user experience
5. Documentation showing performance improvements and architectural benefits
