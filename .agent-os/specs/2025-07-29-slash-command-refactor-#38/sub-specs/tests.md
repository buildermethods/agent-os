## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Bash Script Testing**
- Test workspace-hygiene-check.sh with various git states (clean, dirty, different branches)
- Test project-context-loader.sh with different project configurations
- Test task-validator.sh with consistent and inconsistent task states
- Test error handling for missing dependencies (git, gh CLI)
- Test cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux)

**Workflow Module Testing**
- Verify each workflow module is under 5k characters
- Test module imports work correctly with `@` prefix
- Validate instruction completeness compared to original
- Test conditional module loading based on workflow state

**Orchestrator Testing**
- Test execute-tasks.md loads without performance warnings
- Verify bash execution works correctly with `!` prefix
- Test error handling for failed bash scripts
- Validate user guidance and feedback messages

### Integration Tests

**Complete Workflow Testing**
- Test end-to-end execution of /execute-tasks command
- Verify all original functionality is preserved
- Test workflow with different Agent OS project states
- Validate GitHub integration (issues, PRs, branches)

**Performance Testing**
- Measure command load time before and after refactor
- Verify elimination of Claude Code performance warnings
- Test memory usage with new modular architecture
- Validate response time improvements

**Compatibility Testing**
- Test with existing Agent OS installations
- Verify backward compatibility with current projects
- Test integration with other Agent OS commands
- Validate Claude Code integration functionality

### Feature Tests

**User Experience Scenarios**
- Execute complete spec creation and task execution workflow
- Test workspace hygiene enforcement and recovery
- Verify project context loading and memory refresh
- Test task validation and reality checking

**Error Recovery Scenarios**  
- Test behavior with missing bash scripts
- Verify graceful handling of import failures
- Test recovery from interrupted workflows
- Validate error messages and user guidance

### Mocking Requirements

**Git Command Mocking**
- Mock git status for various repository states
- Mock git branch operations and failures
- Mock GitHub CLI responses for PR and issue operations

**File System Mocking**
- Mock missing Agent OS project files
- Mock various project directory structures
- Mock file read/write permissions issues

**Claude Code Integration Mocking**
- Mock bash execution results for testing orchestrator
- Mock file import behavior for module testing
- Mock performance warning scenarios
