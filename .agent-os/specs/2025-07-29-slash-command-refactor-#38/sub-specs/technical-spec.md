# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-slash-command-refactor-#38/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-29
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Execute-tasks.md must be reduced from 57,576 characters to under 5,000 characters
- All slash commands must load without Claude Code performance warnings
- Bash scripts must use proper error handling and be cross-platform compatible
- File imports must use `@` prefix for Claude Code context loading
- Dynamic operations must use `!` prefix for bash execution
- Modular architecture must maintain exact functional equivalence
- Performance improvements must be measurable and documented

## Approach Options

**Option A: Complete Rewrite with New Architecture**
- Pros: Clean slate implementation, optimal design patterns, clear separation of concerns
- Cons: High risk, extensive testing required, potential functionality gaps

**Option B: Incremental Refactoring with Compatibility Layer** (Selected)
- Pros: Lower risk, gradual migration, maintains backward compatibility, easier testing
- Cons: Temporary code complexity, requires multiple phases

**Option C: External Tool Integration**
- Pros: Leverage existing tools, potentially faster implementation
- Cons: External dependencies, may not align with Agent OS philosophy

**Rationale:** Option B provides the safest path while achieving performance goals. The incremental approach allows thorough testing at each phase and maintains user workflow continuity.

## External Dependencies

**No New External Dependencies Required**
- Solution uses existing bash, git, and GitHub CLI tools already required by Agent OS
- Claude Code integration uses built-in `!` and `@` prefix capabilities
- All components remain within Agent OS's dependency-free architecture

## Architecture Design

### Current Monolithic Structure
```
/execute-tasks → execute-tasks.md (57k chars)
                └── All workflow logic embedded
```

### Target Modular Structure
```
/execute-tasks → execute-tasks.md (< 5k chars)
                ├── ! workspace-hygiene-check.sh
                ├── ! project-context-loader.sh  
                ├── @ workflow-modules/step-1-hygiene.md
                ├── @ workflow-modules/step-2-context.md
                ├── @ workflow-modules/step-3-implementation.md
                └── @ workflow-modules/step-4-integration.md
```

### Component Breakdown

**Lightweight Orchestrator (execute-tasks.md)**
- Command entry point and workflow coordination
- Dynamic context detection and bash script execution  
- File import orchestration based on workflow state
- Error handling and user guidance

**Bash Execution Scripts**
- `workspace-hygiene-check.sh`: Git status, branch validation, issue checking
- `project-context-loader.sh`: Tech stack detection, memory refresh, reality checks
- `task-validator.sh`: Task consistency verification and status management

**Importable Workflow Modules**
- `step-1-hygiene.md`: Workspace hygiene instructions (< 5k chars)
- `step-2-context.md`: Context analysis and task assignment (< 5k chars)  
- `step-3-implementation.md`: Development execution guidelines (< 5k chars)
- `step-4-integration.md`: Git workflow and completion process (< 5k chars)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Bash Script Creation
1. Extract dynamic operations from execute-tasks.md
2. Create bash scripts for hygiene checking and context loading
3. Implement error handling and cross-platform compatibility
4. Test bash scripts independently

### Phase 2: Workflow Module Splitting  
1. Split execute-tasks.md into logical workflow modules
2. Ensure each module is under 5k characters
3. Maintain complete instruction coverage
4. Test modules for completeness

### Phase 3: Orchestrator Implementation
1. Create lightweight execute-tasks.md orchestrator
2. Implement dynamic bash execution logic
3. Add conditional module importing
4. Integrate error handling and user feedback

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
1. Test complete workflow with new architecture
2. Validate performance improvements
3. Ensure functional equivalence with original
4. Document performance gains
