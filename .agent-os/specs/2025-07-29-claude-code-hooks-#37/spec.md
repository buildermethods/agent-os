# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Claude Code Hooks Implementation
> Created: 2025-07-29
> GitHub Issue: #37
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement deterministic Claude Code hooks for Agent OS workflow enforcement to solve the critical workflow abandonment problem where users receive quality check summaries but then abandon the workflow without proper completion.

## User Stories

### AI Workflow Abandonment Prevention

As a developer using Agent OS workflows, I want the system to automatically enforce workflow completion so that I don't accidentally abandon tasks after quality checks and leave work in an incomplete state.

When I complete an Agent OS workflow (execute-tasks, create-spec), the system should automatically detect completion and prevent me from starting new work until proper cleanup is performed. This includes ensuring PRs are merged, issues are closed, and the workspace is reset to a clean state.

### Automatic Documentation Commits

As a developer using Agent OS, I want my spec planning and documentation changes to be automatically committed so that my workflow progress is preserved and tracked without manual intervention.

When I create specs or update Agent OS documentation, the system should automatically commit these changes with proper commit messages that reference the relevant GitHub issues, ensuring complete traceability of all workflow activities.

### Contextual Workflow Injection

As a developer using Agent OS, I want the system to automatically inject relevant context when I start new work so that the AI assistant has immediate access to current project state and standards without manual file referencing.

When I begin any Agent OS workflow, the system should automatically inject current project context including recent specs, active tasks, and relevant standards files, enabling the AI to provide more accurate and contextually appropriate assistance.

## Spec Scope

1. **Stop Hook Implementation** - Detect Agent OS workflow completion and enforce cleanup before allowing new work
2. **PostToolUse Hook Implementation** - Auto-commit documentation changes during Agent OS workflows with proper issue referencing
3. **UserPromptSubmit Hook Implementation** - Inject relevant Agent OS context automatically based on detected workflow patterns
4. **Hook Configuration System** - Create JSON configuration files for Claude Code hook registration and management
5. **Workflow Detection Logic** - Implement intelligent detection of Agent OS workflow states and completion criteria

## Out of Scope

- Hooks for other AI tools beyond Claude Code (future phase)
- Complex workflow state management beyond basic completion detection
- GUI interfaces for hook configuration
- Integration with external project management tools beyond GitHub

## Expected Deliverable

1. Claude Code users experience automatic workflow enforcement with no manual intervention required
2. All Agent OS documentation changes are automatically committed with proper GitHub issue references
3. Agent OS workflows automatically inject relevant project context for improved AI assistance accuracy
