# PEER Agents Declarative Transformation - Lite Summary

Transform the four PEER subagents from script-based implementations to declarative process flows following Agent OS instruction patterns, eliminating bash dependencies and temp file usage.

## Key Points
- Convert peer-planner, peer-executor, peer-express, and peer-review to use XML-like declarative steps
- Replace fragmented state management with single unified NATS KV entry per cycle
- Implement optimistic locking using sequence numbers to prevent state corruption during concurrent access
