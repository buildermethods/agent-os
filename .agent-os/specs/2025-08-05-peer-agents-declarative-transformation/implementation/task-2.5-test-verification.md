# Task 2.5: Test Planner Phase Execution Without Bash Dependencies

> Subtask of Task 2: Transform peer-planner to Declarative Pattern
> Created: 2025-08-05

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive test verification that the declarative peer-planner operates without any bash script dependencies.

## Bash Dependency Elimination Checklist

### ✅ No Bash Tool Usage
- **Old**: Used Bash tool for all operations
- **New**: No Bash tool in tools list (only Read, Grep, Glob)

### ✅ No Shell Scripts
- **Old**: Complex bash scripts with conditionals and loops
- **New**: XML-structured declarative process flow

### ✅ No Temp Files
- **Old**: `/tmp/peer_*.txt` files for context passing
- **New**: Direct NATS KV state reading

### ✅ No Shell Commands
- **Old**: `source`, `cat`, `echo`, `jq`, `awk`, `sed`
- **New**: Declarative operations and transformations

### ✅ No Process Spawning
- **Old**: Spawned subprocesses for JSON manipulation
- **New**: In-process state manipulation

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Planning Cycle

**Scenario**: Create a plan for create-spec instruction

**Initial State**:
```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "sequence": 1,
  "status": "PLANNING",
  "metadata": {
    "instruction_name": "create-spec",
    "cycle_number": 1,
    "key_prefix": "peer:spec:new-feature"
  },
  "context": {
    "peer_mode": "new",
    "spec_aware": true,
    "user_requirements": "Build password reset feature"
  },
  "phases": {
    "plan": {
      "status": "pending"
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected Operations**:
1. Read state from NATS KV with sequence capture
2. Validate planning is allowed
3. Read instruction file with Read tool
4. Generate plan structure in memory
5. Update state with optimistic locking
6. Publish completion event

**Verification Points**:
- ✅ No bash commands executed
- ✅ No temp files created or read
- ✅ Single atomic state update
- ✅ Sequence number properly incremented

**Expected Final State**:
```json
{
  "sequence": 2,
  "status": "EXECUTING",
  "phases": {
    "plan": {
      "status": "complete",
      "output": {
        "instruction": "create-spec",
        "type": "spec-aware",
        "spec_name": "password-reset-feature",
        "phases": [...]
      },
      "completed_at": "2025-08-05T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Continuation Mode

**Scenario**: Skip planning for already-complete plan

**Initial State**:
```json
{
  "sequence": 5,
  "status": "EXECUTING",
  "context": {
    "peer_mode": "continue"
  },
  "phases": {
    "plan": {
      "status": "complete",
      "output": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Read state and detect plan already complete
2. Skip to step 7 (provide summary)
3. No state updates needed

**Verification Points**:
- ✅ No unnecessary state updates
- ✅ Efficient skip logic without bash conditionals

### Test 3: Concurrent Access Handling

**Scenario**: Two agents attempt planning simultaneously

**Setup**:
```yaml
Agent A: Reads state with sequence=10
Agent B: Reads state with sequence=10
Agent A: Completes plan and writes with expected_sequence=10 (succeeds)
Agent B: Attempts write with expected_sequence=10 (fails)
```

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Agent A succeeds, sequence becomes 11
2. Agent B gets sequence mismatch error
3. Agent B retries with fresh read
4. Agent B detects plan already complete
5. Agent B skips update

**Verification Points**:
- ✅ No race conditions
- ✅ Proper conflict detection
- ✅ Automatic retry logic works
- ✅ No bash-based locking needed

### Test 4: Spec Name Determination

**Scenario**: Determine spec name from user requirements

**Input Context**:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "instruction_name": "create-spec"
  },
  "context": {
    "user_requirements": "Build a user profile dashboard with settings"
  }
}
```

**Expected Processing**:
1. Extract keywords: ["build", "user", "profile", "dashboard", "settings"]
2. Remove common words: ["user", "profile", "dashboard", "settings"]
3. Format as kebab-case: "user-profile-dashboard-settings"
4. Store in plan output

**Verification Points**:
- ✅ No bash text processing (sed, awk)
- ✅ Declarative keyword extraction
- ✅ In-memory string manipulation

### Test 5: Error Handling

**Scenario**: NATS connection failure during update

**Test Steps**:
1. Read state successfully
2. Generate plan
3. Simulate NATS failure on write
4. Verify error handling

**Expected Behavior**:
```xml
<error type="state_update_failure">
  <message>Failed to update state: NATS connection lost</message>
  <recovery>Retry operation when connection restored</recovery>
  <state>No partial updates - state unchanged</state>
</error>
```

**Verification Points**:
- ✅ No bash error handling (set -e, trap)
- ✅ Structured error reporting
- ✅ State integrity maintained
