# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement comprehensive git commit plan execution system with NATS KV state management for complex multi-branch operations. Enable agents to execute commit plans with conflict handling, branch management, and resume capability after interruptions.

System manages execution state through timestamped NATS KV keys (peer.commit.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm), provides structured conflict resolution with specific stash labels, and supports user-guided decisions for multi-branch file dependencies. Includes continue pattern for seamless workflow recovery after manual conflict resolution.
