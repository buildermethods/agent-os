# Task 1.1: Process Flow Structure Validation Tests

## Overview

This document defines what tests would validate that the PEER pattern process flow structure matches the Agent OS pattern. Since the Agent OS instruction files are markdown-based process definitions rather than executable code, these are conceptual test requirements that validate the structure and patterns.

## Test Requirements for Process Flow Validation

### 1. Process Flow Structure Tests

#### Test: Validate XML-like Process Flow Structure
- **Purpose**: Ensure peer.md uses `<process_flow>` with numbered `<step>` elements
- **Validation Points**:
  - Process flow must be wrapped in `<process_flow>` tags
  - Each step must have `number`, `name` attributes
  - Steps that delegate must have `subagent` attribute
  - Steps must be sequentially numbered

#### Test: Validate Step Structure Pattern
- **Purpose**: Ensure each step follows the Agent OS pattern
- **Expected Pattern**:
  ```xml
  <step number="X" [subagent="agent-name"] name="step_name">
    ### Step X: Step Title
    
    Description of step purpose
    
    <instructions>
      ACTION: What to do
      REQUEST: How to request from subagent (if applicable)
      WAIT: What to wait for
      PROCESS: How to process results
    </instructions>
  </step>
  ```

### 2. Preflight Check Pattern Tests

#### Test: Validate Preflight Structure
- **Purpose**: Ensure proper preflight check implementation
- **Validation Points**:
  - Must have `<pre_flight_check>` section
  - Must execute meta preflight: `EXECUTE: @~/.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md`
  - Additional preflight validations must use proper conditional logic

### 3. Subagent Delegation Pattern Tests

#### Test: Validate Subagent Step Attributes
- **Purpose**: Ensure subagent steps have proper attributes
- **Validation Points**:
  - Steps with subagents must have `subagent="agent-name"` attribute
  - Must have corresponding `<instructions>` block
  - Instructions must include REQUEST format for subagent

#### Test: Validate Subagent Communication Pattern
- **Purpose**: Ensure proper REQUEST/RESPONSE pattern
- **Expected Pattern**:
  ```xml
  <instructions>
    ACTION: Use [subagent-name] subagent
    REQUEST: "[Specific request with context]"
    WAIT: For [expected output]
    PROCESS: [How to handle response]
  </instructions>
  ```

### 4. Conditional Logic Pattern Tests

#### Test: Validate Conditional Logic Blocks
- **Purpose**: Ensure proper conditional logic implementation
- **Validation Points**:
  - Conditional logic wrapped in appropriate tags
  - Uses IF/ELSE/THEN structure
  - Clear decision paths
  - No external script dependencies for logic

#### Test: Validate Decision Tree Structure
- **Purpose**: Ensure decision trees follow Agent OS pattern
- **Expected Pattern**:
  ```xml
  <decision_tree>
    IF condition:
      ACTION/ERROR/PROCEED
    ELSE IF other_condition:
      ACTION/ERROR/PROCEED
    ELSE:
      DEFAULT action
  </decision_tree>
  ```

### 5. Error Handling Pattern Tests

#### Test: Validate Error Handling Structure
- **Purpose**: Ensure errors handled through process logic
- **Validation Points**:
  - Error conditions defined in conditional blocks
  - Clear error messages and recovery instructions
  - No reliance on script exit codes
  - Process-based error recovery paths

### 6. Reference Command Pattern Tests

#### Test: Validate Reference Command Format
- **Purpose**: Ensure reference commands follow notification pattern
- **Expected Pattern**:
  ```xml
  <reference_command_name>
    command --with --flags
  </reference_command_name>
  ```
- **Validation Points**:
  - Commands are reference examples only
  - Not wrapped in Bash tool calls
  - Clear indication they are examples

### 7. Process vs Script Orchestration Tests

#### Test: No Script Dependency Validation
- **Purpose**: Ensure no external script dependencies
- **Validation Points**:
  - No Bash tool calls to `~/.agent-os/scripts/peer/*.sh`
  - All logic implemented through process flow
  - State management through subagent delegation
  - Validation through conditional logic blocks

#### Test: Process Coordination Pattern
- **Purpose**: Ensure proper process coordination
- **Validation Points**:
  - Steps coordinate through instructions and subagents
  - No external state files except as documented context
  - Clear data flow between steps
  - Validation checkpoints between phases

## Summary

These test requirements validate that the PEER pattern implementation follows the established Agent OS instruction patterns. The key validation points ensure:

1. Proper XML-like structure with numbered steps
2. Correct subagent delegation patterns
3. Process-based logic instead of script orchestration
4. Conditional logic and decision trees for flow control
5. Error handling through process instructions
6. Reference commands following the notification pattern
7. Complete elimination of external script dependencies

This conceptual test framework ensures the redesigned peer.md will be reliable, maintainable, and consistent with other Agent OS instructions.
