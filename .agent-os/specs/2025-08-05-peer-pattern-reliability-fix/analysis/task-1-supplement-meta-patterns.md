# Task 1 Supplement: Additional Meta-Patterns

## Overview

This supplement documents additional meta-level patterns identified during the thinkdeep analysis that are important for the PEER pattern redesign.

## Meta-Level Patterns

### 1. File Reference Pattern (@)

Instructions reference other files using the @ prefix:
- `@~/.agent-os/instructions/core/execute-task.md` - Core instructions
- `@.agent-os/product/mission-lite.md` - Product files  
- `@~/.agent-os/standards/best-practices.md` - Standards files

This pattern indicates file loading or referencing within the Agent OS system.

### 2. Meta Instruction Pattern

The pre_flight_check consistently loads meta instructions:
```xml
<pre_flight_check>
  EXECUTE: @~/.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md
</pre_flight_check>
```

This ensures common pre-flight rules are always executed before the main process flow.

### 3. Instruction Loading Directives

Two patterns for loading other instructions:
- `EXECUTE:` - Run another instruction file
- `LOAD:` - Load content for reference

Example:
```xml
<execution_flow>
  LOAD @~/.agent-os/instructions/core/execute-task.md ONCE
</execution_flow>
```

### 4. Template Variable Convention

Variables use [PLACEHOLDER] format:
- `[SPEC_NAME]` - Spec name variable
- `[CURRENT_DATE]` - Date variable
- `[USER_INPUT]` - User-provided values

This convention clearly distinguishes variables from literal text.

### 5. Version Header Pattern

All instruction files start with a YAML-like header:
```yaml
---
description: [Purpose of instruction]
globs:
alwaysApply: false
version: X.X
encoding: UTF-8
---
```

This provides metadata for the Agent OS parser.

### 6. Final Checklist Pattern

Instructions often end with a verification checklist:
```xml
<final_checklist>
  <verify>
    - [ ] Item 1 completed
    - [ ] Item 2 verified
    - [ ] Item 3 validated
  </verify>
</final_checklist>
```

This ensures all critical steps are completed before finishing.

## State Management Insights (from Expert Analysis)

### Current Implicit State

The script-based approach likely uses:
- Temporary files in `/tmp/`
- Hardcoded paths
- Environment variables
- Shared working directories

### Required Explicit State Management

Process-based approach should:
- Define clear context objects
- Pass state through subagent parameters
- Use explicit input/output paths
- Maintain state visibility in process flow

### PEER Data Contract Recommendation

The expert recommends creating a formal data contract:
- `peer-plan` output: `plan.json`
- `peer-execute` input: `plan.json`, output: `execution_results.json`
- `peer-express` input: `execution_results.json`, output: `express_output.json`
- `peer-review` input: all previous outputs, output: `review.md`

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Context Object Pattern

Agent OS likely manages state through:
- Environment variables scoped to process
- JSON/YAML context objects
- File paths as explicit arguments
- Subagent REQUEST/RESPONSE contracts

### 2. Subagent Interface Requirements

Subagents should support:
- `--input-file` or similar for input paths
- `--output-dir` for output location
- No hardcoded paths
- Explicit state handling

### 3. Process Flow State

State should flow through:
- Step outputs feeding next step inputs
- Clear data transformation at each phase
- Traceable state evolution
- No hidden dependencies

## Summary

These meta-patterns complete the Agent OS pattern analysis:
- File references use @ prefix
- Meta instructions ensure consistent setup
- Variables use [PLACEHOLDER] convention
- Headers provide instruction metadata
- Checklists verify completion
- State management must be explicit

Combined with the core patterns documented in tasks 1.1-1.8, this provides a complete foundation for the PEER pattern redesign.
