# Task 4.7: NATS CLI Commands as Reference Examples Documentation Test

## Test Validation

This test documents and verifies that all NATS CLI commands in peer.md are presented as reference examples only, not for direct execution.

## Test Results

✅ **PASSED**: All NATS commands properly documented as reference examples

### NATS CLI Reference Commands Found

## 1. Health Check Command
```xml
<nats_health_command>
  nats kv ls --timeout=5s
</nats_health_command>
```
- **Purpose**: Example of how to check NATS server availability
- **Context**: Step 1 - NATS Server Availability Check
- **Usage**: Reference only, not executed by the system

## 2. Bucket Configuration Command
```xml
<bucket_configuration>
  nats kv add agent-os-peer-state --replicas=3 --history=50 --description="PEER pattern state storage for Agent OS"
</bucket_configuration>
```
- **Purpose**: Example of bucket creation with required parameters
- **Context**: Step 2 - KV Bucket Verification
- **Usage**: Reference for manual bucket creation if needed

## Command Presentation Pattern

1. **XML Tag Wrapping**
   - Commands enclosed in descriptive XML tags
   - Tag names indicate command purpose
   - Clear separation from process logic

2. **No Execution Instructions**
   - No "RUN:" or "EXECUTE:" prefixes
   - No Bash tool invocation
   - No script execution directives

3. **Documentation Context**
   - Commands appear alongside process logic
   - Serve as examples for manual verification
   - Parameters clearly specified for reference

## NATS Operations in Process Instructions

The process also includes NATS operations as instruction text:

```
STORE in NATS KV: peer.context.current_execution.peer_mode = "[PEER_MODE]"
UPDATE in NATS KV: [KEY_PREFIX].cycle.[CYCLE_NUMBER].status = "completed"
RETRIEVE from NATS KV: criteria.[INSTRUCTION_NAME]
```

These are:
- ✅ Process instructions, not commands
- ✅ Describe what the AI should do
- ✅ Not shell commands to execute

## Comparison with Other Agent OS Instructions

### Similar Pattern in execute-tasks.md:
```xml
<notification_command>
  afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
</notification_command>
```
- Also wrapped in XML tag
- Reference example
- Not executed via script

## Key Distinctions

1. **Reference vs Execution**
   - Reference: Shows what command would look like
   - Execution: Would use Bash tool or script

2. **Documentation vs Implementation**
   - Documentation: "Here's the command format"
   - Implementation: "Run this command now"

3. **Manual vs Automated**
   - Manual: User can run if troubleshooting
   - Automated: System executes directly

## Benefits of Reference-Only Approach

1. **Flexibility**
   - AI can adapt based on context
   - Not locked into specific command execution

2. **Debugging**
   - Users can see exact commands
   - Can run manually for troubleshooting

3. **Safety**
   - No risk of command injection
   - No unexpected side effects

4. **Portability**
   - Works across different environments
   - Not dependent on specific CLI versions

## Conclusion

All NATS CLI commands in peer.md are properly documented as reference examples only. They provide clear documentation of command syntax and parameters without any direct execution, following the established Agent OS pattern for reference commands.
