# Task 4.2: NATS CLI Command Reference Pattern Test

## Test Validation

This test verifies that NATS CLI commands are presented as reference examples following the notification_command pattern used in other Agent OS instructions.

## Test Results

✅ **PASSED**: NATS CLI commands properly presented as reference examples

### Pattern Validation

1. **Reference Command Pattern Found**
   - ✅ `<nats_health_command>` block contains example command
   - ✅ `<bucket_configuration>` block contains example command
   - ✅ Commands shown for documentation/reference purposes

2. **Command Examples**

   ```xml
   <nats_health_command>
     nats kv ls --timeout=5s
   </nats_health_command>
   ```
   
   ```xml
   <bucket_configuration>
     nats kv add agent-os-peer-state --replicas=3 --history=50 --description="PEER pattern state storage for Agent OS"
   </bucket_configuration>
   ```

3. **Pattern Consistency with Agent OS**
   - ✅ Similar to `<notification_command>` in execute-tasks.md
   - ✅ Commands wrapped in descriptive XML tags
   - ✅ Clear intent that these are reference examples

## Key Differences from Script Approach

1. **Reference vs Execution**
   - Old: Scripts would execute these commands directly
   - New: Commands shown as examples for manual verification if needed

2. **Process Logic vs Direct Execution**
   - Old: Script would run `nats kv ls` and parse output
   - New: Process logic describes validation steps, command is reference

3. **Error Handling**
   - Old: Script would trap command failures
   - New: `<failure_handler>` blocks describe error scenarios

## Additional NATS Reference Commands in peer.md

The instruction also includes NATS KV operations in storage patterns:

```
STORE in NATS KV: peer.context.current_execution.peer_mode = "[PEER_MODE]"
UPDATE in NATS KV: [KEY_PREFIX].cycle.[CYCLE_NUMBER].status = "completed"
```

These are presented as process instructions rather than executable commands, which is the correct pattern.

## Conclusion

The peer.md file correctly implements NATS CLI commands as reference examples following the established Agent OS pattern. Commands are shown for documentation purposes within descriptive XML blocks, not for direct execution.
