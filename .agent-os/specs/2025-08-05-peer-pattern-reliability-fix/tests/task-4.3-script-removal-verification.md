# Task 4.3: Script Removal Verification Test

## Test Validation

This test verifies that all calls to ~/.agent-os/scripts/peer/*.sh files have been removed from peer.md.

## Test Results

âœ… **PASSED**: No script calls found in peer.md

### Verification Steps

1. **Pattern Search for Script Paths**
   ```bash
   grep -E "~/\.agent-os/scripts/peer/.*\.sh" instructions/core/peer.md
   # Result: No matches
   ```

2. **General Script Directory Search**
   ```bash
   grep -E "scripts/peer" instructions/core/peer.md
   # Result: No matches
   ```

3. **Shell Extension Search**
   ```bash
   grep "\.sh" instructions/core/peer.md
   # Result: No matches
   ```

4. **Bash Tool Usage Search**
   ```bash
   grep -i "bash tool" instructions/core/peer.md
   # Result: No matches
   ```

## Scripts That Were Removed

Based on the analysis documents, the following scripts were eliminated:

1. **check-nats-health.sh** 
   - Replaced by: `<validation_logic>` in step 1
   - Reference command: `<nats_health_command>`

2. **setup-kv-bucket.sh**
   - Replaced by: `<bucket_check_logic>` in step 2
   - Reference command: `<bucket_configuration>`

3. **parse-arguments.sh**
   - Replaced by: `<argument_validation>` in step 3
   - Logic embedded in process flow

4. **determine-context.sh**
   - Replaced by: `<context_classification>` in step 4
   - Logic embedded in process flow

5. **initialize-cycle.sh**
   - Replaced by: `<cycle_logic>` in step 5
   - Direct NATS KV operations in process

6. **finalize-cycle.sh**
   - Replaced by: `<cycle_finalization>` in step 11
   - Direct NATS KV operations in process

## Process-Based Replacements

All script functionality has been replaced with:

1. **Validation Logic Blocks**
   - `<validation_logic>` for conditional checks
   - `<failure_handler>` for error scenarios

2. **Process Instructions**
   - Direct NATS KV operations described in process
   - State management through process variables

3. **Reference Commands**
   - NATS CLI examples for manual verification
   - Not executed by the system

## Conclusion

All script dependencies have been successfully removed from peer.md. The instruction now uses pure process-based coordination following Agent OS patterns.
