# Task 4.1: No Script Dependencies Test

## Test Validation

This test verifies that the peer.md instruction file contains no external script dependencies and follows a pure process-based coordination pattern.

## Test Results

✅ **PASSED**: No shell script references found in peer.md

### Test Execution

```bash
# Test for shell script references
grep -E '\.sh|scripts/peer' instructions/core/peer.md
# Result: No matches found
```

### Validation Points

1. **No Shell Script Extensions**
   - ✅ No `.sh` file references found
   - ✅ No calls to bash scripts

2. **No Script Directory References**
   - ✅ No references to `~/.agent-os/scripts/peer/` directory
   - ✅ No script path patterns detected

3. **Process-Based Coordination**
   - ✅ All logic expressed through XML-like process flow
   - ✅ Conditional logic handled through `<conditional_execution>` blocks
   - ✅ Error handling through `<failure_handler>` blocks
   - ✅ State management through NATS KV operations

4. **NATS CLI Commands as Reference Only**
   - ✅ Commands shown in `<nats_health_command>` blocks as examples
   - ✅ Commands shown in `<bucket_configuration>` blocks as reference
   - ✅ No direct script execution via Bash tool

## Key Improvements from Script-Based Approach

1. **Elimination of Race Conditions**
   - Scripts could fail due to timing issues
   - Process flow ensures sequential execution with proper validation

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - Scripts had limited error recovery
   - Process flow has explicit `<failure_handler>` blocks at each step

3. **Consistent with Agent OS Patterns**
   - Scripts were external to the instruction pattern
   - Process flow follows established XML-like structure from other instructions

4. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Scripts required separate maintenance
   - Process logic is self-contained within the instruction

## Conclusion

The peer.md file successfully implements a pure process-based coordination pattern with no external script dependencies. All orchestration logic is contained within the instruction file using Agent OS standard patterns.
