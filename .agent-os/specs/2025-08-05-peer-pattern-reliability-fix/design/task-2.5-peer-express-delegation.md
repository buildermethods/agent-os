<step number="9" subagent="peer-express" name="express_phase">

### Step 9: Express Phase

Use the peer-express subagent to format and present the execution results professionally.

<phase_validation>
  CHECK: Execution phase completed
  VERIFY: Execution results exist at [KEY_PREFIX]:cycle:[CYCLE_NUMBER]:execution
  IF execution results not available:
    ERROR: "Cannot express without completed execution phase"
    PROVIDE: "Ensure execution phase completed successfully"
    STOP execution
</phase_validation>

## Context Passing Details

### Input Context

The express agent receives:
1. **Cycle Information**: For retrieving all phase outputs
2. **Instruction Type**: For appropriate formatting
3. **Phase Results**: Plan, execution, deliverables
4. **NATS Locations**: For accessing stored data

### Output Expectations

The express agent should produce:
1. **Full Presentation**: Complete formatted output
2. **Executive Summary**: Quick overview
3. **Metrics**: Quantifiable results
4. **Visual Formatting**: Professional appearance

### State Management

```
NATS KV Keys:
- [KEY_PREFIX]:cycle:[CYCLE_NUMBER]:express         ‚Üí Full presentation
- [KEY_PREFIX]:cycle:[CYCLE_NUMBER]:express_summary ‚Üí Executive summary
- [KEY_PREFIX]:cycle:[CYCLE_NUMBER]:express_metrics ‚Üí Quantifiable metrics
- [KEY_PREFIX]:cycle:[CYCLE_NUMBER]:phases_completed ‚Üí Updated to include "express"
```

## Formatting Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy
```
# Main Title
## Section Headers
### Subsections
- Bullet points for lists
  - Nested items with indentation
**Bold** for emphasis
`code` for technical terms
```

### Visual Indicators
- ‚úÖ Completed successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Completed with warnings
- ‚ùå Failed or blocked
- üìÅ Created new file/directory
- üîß Modified existing file
- üìä Metrics or measurements
- üöÄ Deployed or launched
- üìù Documentation created

### Instruction-Specific Templates

#### create-spec Template
```
## Spec Created: [SPEC_NAME]

### Documentation Generated
‚úÖ Spec requirements document
‚úÖ Technical specifications
‚úÖ Task breakdown
‚úÖ Database schema (if applicable)

### Location
üìÅ `.agent-os/specs/[DATE]-[SPEC_NAME]/`
```

#### execute-tasks Template
```
## Tasks Completed: [X] of [Y]

### Implementation Summary
‚úÖ Task 1: [Description] - [Status]
‚úÖ Task 2: [Description] - [Status]

### Test Results
üìä Tests passed: [X]/[Y]
```

## Quality Criteria

A successful express phase:
1. Accurately summarizes work done
2. Highlights key achievements
3. Documents all deliverables
4. Uses clear, professional language
5. Provides actionable information
6. Is visually well-organized

## Integration Considerations

### 1. Data Retrieval
The express agent must:
- Access multiple NATS KV keys
- Parse JSON execution data
- Correlate plan with results

### 2. Adaptive Formatting
Based on:
- Instruction type
- Execution success level
- Deliverable types
- User needs

### 3. Clarity Focus
Prioritize:
- What was accomplished
- Where to find results
- What happens next
- Any important notes

## Summary

This delegation pattern ensures the peer-express:
- Retrieves comprehensive execution data
- Creates professional presentations
- Adapts to instruction types
- Highlights value delivered
- Stores formatted outputs
- Serves stakeholder needs

The detailed REQUEST ensures consistent, high-quality presentation of PEER execution results.
