## 2025-01-27: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Agent OS is positioned as a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted development workflows, focusing on structured specifications, standardized development practices, and reliable AI tool integration across multiple platforms (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

### Context

AI coding assistants are becoming mainstream, but developers and teams lack systematic approaches to working with them effectively. Most existing solutions are tool-specific or too simplistic for professional development environments.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Tool-Specific Solution**
   - Pros: Deeper integration, fewer compatibility issues
   - Cons: Limited market reach, vendor lock-in, requires separate versions for each tool

2. **Simple Template Library**
   - Pros: Easy to implement, low maintenance
   - Cons: Doesn't address workflow complexity, limited professional utility

3. **SaaS Platform**
   - Pros: Centralized management, recurring revenue potential
   - Cons: Higher development cost, ongoing infrastructure, accessibility barriers

### Rationale

The framework approach provides maximum flexibility and adoption potential while addressing real professional development needs. The shell script + markdown approach ensures broad compatibility and easy customization.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Can support any AI coding tool with minimal adaptation
- Low barrier to adoption for individual developers and teams
- Easily customizable for different tech stacks and practices
- No vendor lock-in or ongoing costs

**Negative:**
- More complex than simple templates
- Requires documentation and user education
- Success depends on community adoption

## 2025-01-27: Distribution Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002  
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Use Git/GitHub with curl installation pattern for distribution, storing user files in ~/.agent-os/ directory structure.

### Context

Need a distribution method that is accessible, secure, version-controlled, and allows for easy updates while preserving user customizations.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **NPM Package**
   - Pros: Familiar to many developers, built-in versioning
   - Cons: Node.js dependency, primarily JavaScript ecosystem

2. **Package Managers (brew, apt)**
   - Pros: Native OS integration, automatic updates
   - Cons: Complex packaging, platform-specific, approval processes

### Rationale

curl + bash is universally available, requires no additional dependencies, provides version control through Git, and allows selective updates with preservation of customizations.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Works on any Unix-like system
- No additional dependencies required
- Easy to inspect before installation
- Preserves user customizations

**Negative:**
- Requires trust in curl + bash pattern
- Manual update process
- Windows compatibility requires WSL

## 2025-01-27: GitHub-First Workflow

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Users

### Decision

All Agent OS workflows require GitHub issues and enforce GitHub-first development practices with automatic PR creation and issue linking.

### Context

Professional development teams need traceability and project management integration. GitHub is the most widely used platform for code collaboration.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Platform Agnostic**
   - Pros: Works with any Git hosting
   - Cons: No standardization, complex configuration, reduced automation

2. **Multi-Platform Support**
   - Pros: Broader compatibility
   - Cons: Significant complexity, reduced feature set, maintenance burden

### Rationale

GitHub dominance in professional development makes it a safe standardization choice. The issue-first approach ensures work traceability and prevents ad-hoc development.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete work traceability
- Professional project management practices
- Automated documentation through PRs and issues
- Integration with existing team workflows

**Negative:**
- GitHub dependency limits some users
- Requires additional setup for GitHub CLI
- More overhead for simple changes
