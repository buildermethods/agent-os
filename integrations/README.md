# Agent OS Subagent Integration

Enhance Agent OS workflows with **optional** professional-grade analysis from your existing Claude Code subagents.

## Philosophy: Security Opt-In, Quality Automatic

This integration gives you **professional-grade development assistance** while respecting your security context:

- **üîí Security**: Always opt-in, never automatic (even for banking apps)
- **üéØ Quality**: Automatic professional assistance (PRDs, testing, architecture)
- **üöÄ Your pace**: Prototype without security overhead, get quality help by default
- **üß† Your context**: You decide when security analysis adds value

## How It Works

The integration adds **optional enhancement points** throughout existing Agent OS workflows:

```

```

### Key Benefits

- **Professional by default**: Automatic PRDs, architecture review, comprehensive testing
- **Security when you want it**: Brief suggestions, easily dismissed, no pressure
- **Respects your context**: Prototype freely, add security when ready for production
- **First-try success**: 90%+ spec approval rates with automatic quality enhancements

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed and configured
- Agent OS already installed
- Claude Code subagents (recommended)

### 2. Install Integration

```bash
cd /path/to/agent-os
chmod +x integrations/setup-subagent-integration.sh
./integrations/setup-subagent-integration.sh
```

### 3. Try Enhanced Workflows

```bash
# Same workflow, automatic quality enhancements
/create-spec "Add user authentication"
# ‚Üí Automatically uses: prd-writer, systems-architect, qa-test-engineer
# ‚Üí Brief suggestion: "Security analysis available for auth features"  
# ‚Üí Your choice: [y/n] (default: n)
# ‚Üí Result: Professional spec with optional security analysis

# Or explicitly request security later
/enhance --security
# ‚Üí Add security analysis to existing spec
```

## Configuration

### Global Configuration
Edit `~/.agent-os/subagent-config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Global subagent integration settings
enabled: true
fallback_mode: graceful

# Quality thresholds
complexity_threshold: medium
risk_threshold: medium

# Workflow enhancements
workflows:
  create_spec:
    enabled: true
    agents:
      systems_architect:
        enabled: true
        auto_invoke: false  # manual for complex features
      qa_test_engineer:
        enabled: true
        auto_invoke: true   # always enhance testing
```

### Project-Specific Configuration
Create `.agent-os/subagent-config.yaml` in your project:

```yaml
# Project-specific overrides
workflows:
  execute_tasks:
    agents:
      security_threat_analyst:
        enabled: true
        auto_invoke: true  # this project is security-critical
```

## Enhanced Workflows

**Standard**: Basic product documentation
**Enhanced**: Professional PRD with market research and architectural validation

```bash
/plan-product-enhanced
```

Features:
- Comprehensive market research and competitive analysis
- Professional PRD with detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical architecture validation and scalability planning
- Enterprise-grade documentation quality

### 2. Enhanced Spec Creation

**Standard**: Basic spec with simple requirements
**Enhanced**: Professional specification with comprehensive analysis

```bash
/create-spec-enhanced "Add user authentication"
```

Features:
- Automatic security analysis for auth features
- Comprehensive test strategy with edge cases
- Technical architecture validation
- Professional user stories with acceptance criteria

### 3. Enhanced Task Execution

**Enhanced**: Professional development with continuous quality assurance

```bash
/execute-tasks-enhanced
```

Features:
- Architectural guidance for complex implementations
- Continuous code quality monitoring

## Quality Outcomes

### Before Integration
- ‚úÖ Structured workflows
- ‚úÖ Consistent processes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Variable quality outcomes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual quality assurance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic documentation

### After Integration
- ‚úÖ Structured workflows (unchanged)
- ‚úÖ Consistent processes (unchanged)
- ‚úÖ **Professional quality outcomes**
- ‚úÖ **Automated quality assurance**
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise-grade documentation**
- ‚úÖ **First-try success rates: 90%+**

## Fallback Behavior

The integration is **completely optional** and **fully backward compatible**:

- **No subagents**: Standard Agent OS workflows continue unchanged
- **Partial subagents**: Use available agents, skip unavailable ones
- **Agent errors**: Log errors but never block standard workflows
- **User control**: Disable any agent or enhancement via configuration

## Real-World Examples

### Banking App Prototype
```bash
/create-spec "User account management for banking app"
# ‚Üí Brief note: "Security analysis available for financial applications"
# ‚Üí You choose: n (focusing on core logic first)
# ‚Üí Result: Clean spec focused on functionality
```

### Banking App Going to Production
```bash
# Same spec, now ready for production
/enhance --security --architecture
# ‚Üí Comprehensive security analysis and architectural review added
# ‚Üí Result: Production-ready spec with threat modeling
```

### Personal Blog
```bash
/create-spec "Personal blog with comments"
# ‚Üí No security suggestions (obviously low risk)
# ‚Üí Result: Simple, clean spec for your project
```

### Learning Project
```bash
/create-spec "Todo app to learn React"
# ‚Üí No enhancement suggestions (learning focused)
# ‚Üí Later: /enhance --quality (when you want to learn best practices)
```

The integration **respects your development phase** and **trusts your judgment** about what's appropriate for your specific project and timeline.

## Troubleshooting
