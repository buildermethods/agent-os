# Example: Opt-In Enhancement Integration

This shows how the enhanced create-spec workflow would look with the new opt-in philosophy.

### Step 2.5: Optional Enhancement Suggestions

<step_metadata>
  <purpose>Suggest relevant enhancements based on context, never automatic</purpose>
  <required>false</required>
  <philosophy>Always ask, never assume</philosophy>
</step_metadata>

<enhancement_detection>
  <context_analysis>
    1. Analyze spec description for enhancement opportunities
    2. Check available subagents for applicable improvements
    3. Determine if suggestions would add genuine value
    4. Prepare respectful, dismissible suggestions

<instructions>
  ACTION: Suggest relevant enhancements based on genuine value potential
  PHILOSOPHY: Respectful suggestions, easy dismissal, no pressure
  DEFAULT: Continue standard workflow unless user explicitly opts in
  TIMING: After requirements clarification, before spec creation
</instructions>

## Key Principles Demonstrated

1. **Context-Aware**: Only suggests enhancements that genuinely add value
2. **Easily Dismissed**: Default is "no", single keystroke to dismiss
3. **No Pressure**: Educational framing, not enforcement language
4. **Respects Choice**: No follow-up questions or guilt if declined
5. **Available Later**: User can always add enhancements with /enhance command

This approach ensures that:
- Prototypes stay focused on core functionality
- Production systems can get professional analysis when ready
- Learning projects aren't overwhelmed with unnecessary complexity
- The developer always maintains full control over their workflow
