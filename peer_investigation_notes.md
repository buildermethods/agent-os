# PEER Pattern Investigation Notes

## Initial Assessment

User reports multiple failures in PEER pattern execution:
1. Scripts kept failing during execution
2. Execute phase did not update meta or cycle 
3. No user review prompt for final output
4. Need to check NATS KV keys and spec output files

## Investigation Plan

1. Check NATS KV state with `peer.spec.wal-operation-handling-fix` prefix
2. Examine spec output files at /Users/eduardokolomajr/dev/nexus-rpk/.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-meilisearch-search-endpoint
3. Review conversation history in output-peer-test-2.jsonl
4. Document findings and root causes

## Findings

### NATS KV State Analysis
- Found 2 keys in agent-os-peer-state bucket:
  - `peer.spec.wal-operation-handling-fix.meta`
  - `peer.spec.wal-operation-handling-fix.cycle.1`

### Meta Key Content
```json
{
  "spec_name": "wal-operation-handling-fix", 
  "created_at": "2025-08-05T15:56:53Z",
  "current_cycle": 1,
  "current_phase": "complete",
  "cycles": {
    "1": {
      "instruction": "create-spec",
      "status": "complete", 
      "started_at": "2025-08-05T15:56:53Z",
      "completed_at": "2025-08-05T16:11:30Z",
      "notes": "Execute phase missing - manual completion required"
    }
  }
}
```

**Critical Finding**: The meta shows "Execute phase missing - manual completion required" which confirms user's report that execute phase did not update properly.

### Cycle 1 Detailed Analysis
The cycle data reveals critical issues with PEER execution:

**Completed Phases:**
- ‚úÖ Plan (completed 16:00:14Z) - Generated comprehensive 4-phase plan
- ‚úÖ Express (completed 16:06:11Z) - Formatted planning results professionally  
- ‚úÖ Review (completed 16:09:53Z) - Assessed quality but noted execution incomplete

**Missing Phase:**
- ‚ùå Execute - **Never ran at all**

**Key Evidence:**
- Review phase explicitly notes `"execution_status": "incomplete"`
- Review phase lists `"missing_phases": ["execute"]`
- Final notes state "Execute phase was not completed - cycle requires manual completion"
- Despite this, overall status shows `"current_phase": "complete"` and `"progress_percent": 100`

**Contradiction**: The cycle claims 100% completion while missing the core Execute phase entirely.

### Spec Output File Analysis
Examined the spec files created for the "meilisearch-search-endpoint" spec:

**Files Created Successfully:**
- ‚úÖ `spec.md` - Well-formed spec document with clear requirements
- ‚úÖ `tasks.md` - All tasks marked as completed ([x])  
- ‚úÖ `sub-specs/technical-spec.md` - Technical specifications present
- ‚úÖ `sub-specs/tests.md` - Test specifications present

**Key Observation**: Despite PEER execution never running the execute phase, all task items in `tasks.md` are marked as completed. This suggests either:
1. The tasks were manually marked complete after PEER failure
2. There's a disconnect between PEER execution tracking and actual task completion
3. The spec was completed outside the PEER pattern

### Correct Spec Output File Analysis
Examined the actual spec files for the "wal-operation-handling-fix" spec from PEER execution:

**Files Created:**
- ‚úÖ `spec.md` - 42 lines, complete spec document (matches NATS cycle spec_name)
- ‚úÖ `spec-lite.md` - 3 lines, condensed version
- ‚úÖ `sub-specs/technical-spec.md` - 14 lines, technical requirements  
- ‚ùå `tasks.md` - **MISSING COMPLETELY**

**Critical Finding**: The `tasks.md` file is completely missing. According to the create-spec instruction (step 12), this file should be created after user approval in step 11.

**Evidence of Incomplete Execution:**
1. Spec files show abrupt termination - spec.md ends with "EOF < /dev/null"
2. Technical spec also ends with "EOF < /dev/null" 
3. No tasks.md file created (required by create-spec instruction step 12)
4. Files created match the date (2025-08-05) from PEER cycle data

**Root Cause Confirmed**: PEER execute phase never ran the create-spec instruction to completion. The spec files appear to be partial artifacts from a failed execution attempt.

### Conversation History Analysis (First 10 Lines)

**PEER Execution Started:** 2025-08-05T15:56:07.429Z
**User Command:** `/peer --instruction=create-spec` with WAL template fix requirements

**Early Execution Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Version 1.1 announced
2. ‚úÖ NATS health check passed (15:56:13Z)
3. ‚úÖ Scripts called: `check-nats-health.sh`, `setup-kv-bucket.sh`

**Key Observation from Line 45 (Grep Result):**
- peer-executor subagent was invoked at 16:00:37Z
- Task was to execute create-spec instruction 
- Spec name passed: "wal-operation-handling-fix"
- Instruction was: "Fix WAL template operation handling..."

**Evidence of Script-Based Approach:**
The PEER pattern execution relied heavily on external shell scripts:
- `~/.agent-os/scripts/peer/check-nats-health.sh`
- `~/.agent-os/scripts/peer/setup-kv-bucket.sh`
- Multiple other scripts referenced in process flow

**Preliminary Conclusion:** The execution appears to have started correctly but failed during or after the peer-executor phase, resulting in incomplete spec creation and missing tasks.md file.

## Script Failure Analysis - Beginning Section (Lines 15-24)

### First Major Error (Line 15)
```
‚ùå Error: No spec name provided for create-spec instruction
   Expected: Coordinator should determine spec name in Step 6 and save to /tmp/determined_spec_name.txt
   Or use: --spec=<name> parameter
```

**Issue Found**: The script `determine-context.sh` failed because the coordinator had not yet determined the spec name in Step 6 as required by PEER pattern instructions. This caused the script to fail prematurely.

**Resolution Attempt**: The coordinator then manually wrote the spec name to `/tmp/determined_spec_name.txt` (line 17-18), and the script succeeded on retry (line 20).

**Process Flow Observed**:
1. ‚úÖ NATS health check passed
2. ‚úÖ Bucket setup succeeded  
3. ‚ùå Context determination failed (missing spec name)
4. ‚úÖ Coordinator fixed by writing spec name file
5. ‚úÖ Context determination succeeded on retry
6. ‚úÖ PEER cycle initialization succeeded
7. ‚úÖ peer-planner subagent invoked (line 23)

**Key Insight**: The scripts expected the coordinator to follow a specific sequence but the coordinator skipped Step 6 initially, causing the first failure.

## Script Failure Analysis - Middle Section (Lines 90-105)

### Execution Phase Never Started
At line 92, the peer-express subagent states: "I notice the execution phase hasn't completed yet"
At line 97, check shows execution status: `"not_started"`

**Critical Discovery**: The execution phase was never invoked at all. The PEER flow jumped from planning directly to express, completely skipping the peer-executor subagent running the actual create-spec instruction.

**Flow Breakdown**:
1. ‚úÖ Planning phase completed (16:00:14Z)
2. ‚ùå **Execution phase SKIPPED entirely**
3. ‚úÖ Express phase ran anyway (16:04-16:05)
4. ‚úÖ Review phase ran (16:09-16:11)

**Issue Found**: The PEER orchestration failed to invoke Step 8 (peer-executor subagent) despite the instruction clearly stating it should execute the create-spec instruction.

## Script Failure Analysis - End Section (Lines 175-188)

### False Success Reporting (Line 186)
```bash
üèÅ Finalizing PEER cycle...
‚úÖ PEER cycle 1 completed successfully
```

**Major Problem**: The finalize script reports "completed successfully" despite:
- Execute phase never running (confirmed at line 179)
- Cycle status explicitly set to "incomplete" (line 179)
- Notes stating "Execute phase missing - manual completion required" (line 179)

**State Contradiction**: The meta data correctly shows incomplete status, but the finalize script claims success. This suggests the finalize script doesn't properly validate cycle completeness before reporting success.

## Critical Root Cause Discovery (Lines 46-69)

### The Fatal NATS KV Read Failure (Line 51)
```bash
‚ùå Error: Could not retrieve cycle data
```

**What Happened**: The peer-executor subagent attempted to read the planning data from NATS KV but the read operation failed completely. This meant the executor couldn't access the planning output needed to properly execute the create-spec instruction.

**Command That Failed**: 
```bash
nats kv get agent-os-peer-state "${key_prefix}.cycle.${current_cycle}" --raw
```

**Impact**: Without access to the planning data, the peer-executor was forced to work with incomplete context, leading to:
1. Partial execution of create-spec instruction
2. No proper state tracking in NATS KV 
3. Incomplete spec file creation (terminated at Step 6 of 14)
4. Missing critical files like tasks.md

### Evidence of Partial Recovery Attempt
Lines 53-69 show the peer-executor attempting to continue despite the failure:
- Manually determined spec name: "wal-operation-handling-fix"
- Started create-spec instruction execution 
- Successfully reached Step 6 (create spec.md)
- **Execution terminates abruptly** - conversation log ends mid-process

### Why The Scripts Failed
The PEER pattern's heavy reliance on external shell scripts created multiple points of failure:
1. **Race Condition**: Executor tried to read cycle data before planner finished writing
2. **Error Propagation**: NATS KV read failure cascaded through the entire execution chain
3. **State Inconsistency**: Different components had different views of execution state
4. **No Recovery Mechanism**: When scripts failed, there was no fallback or retry logic

## Root Causes and Recommendations

Based on comprehensive analysis of the PEER pattern execution failure, here are the fundamental issues and recommendations:

### Primary Root Causes

#### 1. Fatal NATS KV Read Failure (Line 51 - Critical)
**Issue**: The peer-executor subagent couldn't read planning data from NATS KV using command:
```bash
nats kv get agent-os-peer-state "${key_prefix}.cycle.${current_cycle}" --raw
```

**Impact**: Without planning data, executor ran blind, creating partial spec files that terminated at Step 6 of 14.

**Recommendation**: 
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for NATS KV operations
- Implement proper error handling that surfaces NATS connection issues
- Add validation to ensure planning data exists before invoking executor

#### 2. Script-Based Orchestration Brittleness (Throughout Execution)
**Issue**: Heavy reliance on external shell scripts created multiple failure points with no error recovery.

**Impact**: Single script failure could cascade and break entire PEER cycle.

**Recommendation**:
- Replace script orchestration with native tool calls
- Implement proper error handling at each phase boundary  
- Add rollback mechanisms for partial failures

#### 3. Race Conditions and Timing Dependencies (Line 15, Line 51)
**Issue**: Scripts assumed specific execution order but phases ran asynchronously.

**Impact**: Context determination failed due to missing spec name file, executor failed due to missing cycle data.

**Recommendation**:
- Add explicit synchronization points between phases
- Validate required data exists before proceeding to next phase
- Use atomic operations for state transitions

#### 4. State Inconsistency and False Success Reporting (Line 186)
**Issue**: Finalize script reported success despite incomplete execution and cycle status being "incomplete".

**Impact**: User gets false confidence in execution completion while critical work remains undone.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement comprehensive validation in finalize script
- Check all required deliverables exist before claiming success
- Add health checks that validate end-to-end execution

#### 5. Missing Execute Phase Orchestration (Lines 90-105)
**Issue**: PEER flow jumped from planning to express, completely skipping the execution phase.

**Impact**: Core instruction (create-spec) never actually ran, resulting in no tasks.md and incomplete deliverables.

**Recommendation**:
- Add explicit phase validation to ensure no phases are skipped
- Implement phase dependency checking (express requires execute completion)
- Add execution status tracking independent of script reporting

### Secondary Issues

#### 6. Inadequate Error Context and Debugging (Throughout)
**Issue**: Script failures provided minimal error context, making root cause analysis difficult.

**Recommendation**:
- Add detailed logging at each script execution point
- Include NATS server status in error messages
- Preserve intermediate state files for debugging

#### 7. File Creation Without Proper Validation (Lines 79-96)
**Issue**: Spec files were created but truncated with "EOF < /dev/null", indicating abrupt termination.

**Recommendation**:
- Add file integrity validation after creation
- Implement checkpoints to ensure each step completes fully
- Add rollback for partial file creation

### Architectural Recommendations

#### Short-term Fixes
1. **Replace Script Orchestration**: Convert shell script calls to direct tool invocations
2. **Add Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for NATS KV operations
3. **Fix Phase Validation**: Ensure execute phase always runs before express/review
4. **Improve Error Reporting**: Surface actual error details instead of generic failures

#### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Implement State Machine**: Replace ad-hoc phase management with formal state machine
2. **Add Health Checks**: Validate NATS connectivity and data availability before proceeding
3. **Create Rollback Mechanisms**: Allow recovery from partial failures
4. **Add Integration Tests**: Test full PEER cycles end-to-end with fault injection

#### Long-term Architecture
1. **Event-Sourced PEER State**: Use proper event sourcing for PEER cycle management
2. **Distributed Transaction Support**: Ensure atomicity across phases
3. **Observable Execution**: Add tracing and metrics for PEER pattern execution
4. **Self-Healing Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery from common failure modes

### Immediate Action Items
1. Fix the NATS KV read operation with proper error handling
2. Add validation to ensure planning data exists before executor runs
3. Remove false success reporting from finalize script
4. Add explicit execute phase validation to prevent skipping
5. Implement file integrity checks for spec creation

### Success Criteria for Fixes
- PEER cycles complete successfully with all phases executed
- No false success reporting when phases fail or are skipped
- Proper error messages that aid in debugging
- Robust handling of NATS connectivity issues
- Complete spec files with all required deliverables (including tasks.md)
