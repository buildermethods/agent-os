# Pre-Flight Rules

- IMPORTANT: For any step that specifies a subagent in the subagent="" XML attribute you MUST use the specified subagent to perform the instructions for that step.

- Process XML blocks sequentially

- Read and execute every numbered step in the process_flow EXACTLY as the instructions specify.

- If you need clarification on any details of your current task, stop and ask the user specific numbered questions and then continue once you have all of the information you need.

- Use exact templates as provided

### Step 0: Intelligent Workflow Analysis (Optional)

Use the workflow-orchestrator subagent to analyze the user request and determine optimal workflow routing and coordination strategy.

<workflow_intelligence_check>
  IF workflow-orchestrator agent is available AND config allows intelligent orchestration:
    ACTION: Use workflow-orchestrator subagent
    REQUEST: "Analyze user request for workflow complexity and routing recommendations:
             - Assess intent complexity and scope
             - Determine optimal agent sequence
             - Identify parallelization opportunities
             - Provide workflow coordination strategy"
    PROCESS: Present workflow plan and routing recommendations
    RESPECT: User preferences for orchestration level
  ELSE:
    SKIP: Continue with standard pre-flight
</workflow_intelligence_check>

<workflow_analysis_areas>
  <intent_classification>
    1. Request complexity assessment (simple, moderate, complex, architectural)
    2. Intent type detection (new_feature, improvement, bug_fix, integration)
    3. Multi-agent coordination requirements analysis
    4. Parallel execution opportunity identification
  </intent_classification>
  
  <routing_intelligence>
    - Smart agent sequence determination
    - Dependency resolution for multi-step workflows
    - Resource optimization and conflict prevention  
    - Timeline estimation with parallelization benefits
  </routing_intelligence>
  
  <coordination_strategy>
    - Sequential coordination for dependent tasks
    - Parallel coordination for independent workstreams
    - Hybrid coordination for complex multi-phase workflows
    - Error recovery and rollback planning
  </coordination_strategy>
</workflow_analysis_areas>

  Use the context-intelligence subagent to analyze usage patterns and provide optimization recommendations for this session.
