## Feedback Collection Methods

### Implicit Feedback
```yaml
Behavioral Signals:
  - Feature usage frequency and duration
  - Optimization acceptance vs. rejection patterns
  - Time spent on tasks with vs. without optimizations
  - User actions after receiving suggestions (comply/ignore/disable)

Performance Indicators:
  - Task completion rates
  - Error frequency and types
  - Help-seeking behavior
  - Feature abandonment patterns

Satisfaction Proxies:
  - Session length trends (longer = more engaged)
  - Return frequency (consistent use = satisfaction)
  - Advanced feature adoption (progression = value found)
  - Recommendation sharing or discussion
```

### Explicit Feedback
```yaml
Micro-Feedback (In-Session):
  - Quick thumbs up/down on optimizations
  - Star ratings for suggestion quality (1-5 scale)
  - "Helpful/Not Helpful" for feature introductions
  - Simple yes/no on "Was this optimization valuable?"

Periodic Surveys:
  - Weekly satisfaction with optimization features
  - Monthly assessment of Agent OS intelligence value
  - Quarterly deep-dive on feature usefulness
  - Annual overall productivity impact evaluation

Contextual Feedback:
  - Post-optimization: "How was that compression?"
  - After suggestion acceptance: "Did this help as expected?"
  - Feature introduction: "How useful was this feature?"
  - Problem resolution: "Did optimizations cause any issues?"
```
